Federal government contracting is a process in which the US government enters into contracts with American businesses to acquire supplies and services needed to operate its operations or fulfill its mission. The US government is the largest consumer in the world and spends billions of dollars each year buying from nonfederal sources. There are over 350,000 government contractors receiving more than $500 billion worth of contracts each year, with $100 billion going to small businesses.

The government purchases a wide variety of products and services, ranging from high-technology items like missiles and aircraft to more mundane items like office furniture and janitorial services. The government’s needs vary, so businesses of all sizes have the opportunity to participate in federal contracting. The government offers a variety of programs and services to help small businesses participate in federal contracting, including credit assistance, procurement opportunities, technical support, and management assistance.

The federal government operates in a monopsonistic market, meaning it is the only buyer in the market. This gives the government certain powers and immunities that differ from typical buyers. Federal contractors must understand the rules and regulations that govern government contracting in order to be successful.

The federal government purchases the majority of its supplies and services from the Department of Defense (DoD), which accounted for over two-thirds of the government’s purchases in 2011. Other top federal agencies include the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The top product or service categories purchased by the government include manufacturing, professional and scientific services, administration and support, construction, and wholesale trade.

The future of federal contracting has seen some backlash under the Obama administration, as government officials and unions question the cost effectiveness of contracting out services. However, contractors still have more flexibility in hiring and laying off employees, contributing to a favorable environment for government service contracts. The government will continue to rely on private-sector vendors for product and supply contracts.

To sell to the federal government, contractors must meet certain criteria and demonstrate that they are eligible and responsible. The government wants to know if a contractor is eligible to do business with the government, if they have adequate financial resources, if they have a good performance record, if they demonstrate ethics and integrity, if they have the necessary skills to perform the job, if they offer fair and reasonable prices, and if they have the necessary facilities and production capacity.

There are advantages and disadvantages to selling to the federal government. The advantages include the fact that the government purchases almost every type of supply and service, the government has thousands of buying offices throughout the country, the government provides free assistance to contractors, and federal business programs often lead to business with other federal agencies and state and local governments. The disadvantages include government red tape and paperwork, the need to learn how the government operates, and the competitive nature of government contracting.

Overall, federal contracting can be a profitable and reliable source of income for businesses, but it requires an understanding of the contracting process and the ability to navigate the government’s rules and regulations.
