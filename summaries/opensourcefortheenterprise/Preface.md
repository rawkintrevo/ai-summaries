This book, titled "Open Source for the Enterprise," written by Dan Woods and Gautam Guliani, serves as a guide to help IT departments navigate the challenges and opportunities of using open source software. The book aims to bridge the gap between programmers and managers, providing practical advice and insights on how to effectively implement open source in an organization.

The book begins by acknowledging the excitement and potential benefits of open source, such as cost reduction and increased negotiation power with vendors. However, it also emphasizes the importance of recognizing the hidden costs, responsibilities, and governance challenges that come with using open source.

The authors argue that if using open source were as simple as installing Linux and using open source tools, then the world would have completely transitioned to open source by now. They suggest that organizations need to understand what open source is and what it is not, evaluate the quality of open source projects, build the necessary skills, calculate the return on investment, design a strategy, find support, productize open source projects, understand licensing, manage risks, and embrace the empowerment that comes with open source adoption.

The book is divided into ten chapters, each addressing a specific aspect of open source adoption. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the nature of open source, tracing its origins, evolution, and life cycle. Chapter 2 focuses on measuring the maturity of open source projects and determining their suitability for an organization. Chapter 3 explores the necessary skill set for implementing open source and suggests strategies for building those skills within the organization.

Chapter 4 delves into the process of making a convincing ROI case for open source, highlighting the potential cost savings and business value. Chapter 5 offers guidance on designing a low-risk open source strategy, ensuring a smooth and successful adoption process. Chapter 6 examines the different support models for open source and provides tips on evaluating and choosing the right support options.

Chapter 7 discusses the challenges of making open source projects easy to adopt and emphasizes the importance of closing the productization gap. Chapter 8 delves into open source licensing, providing an overview of different licenses and their implications. Chapter 9 explores the risks and challenges posed by attacks on open source and suggests strategies for managing those risks. Finally, Chapter 10 explores the impact of open source on IT departments, discussing the choices between building and buying software and the positive changes that open source adoption can bring to an organization.

The book also includes appendices that provide recommendations for open source solutions in various areas, such as end-user computing, email, groupware and collaboration, web publishing and content management, and application development.

The authors emphasize that using open source is not a solution that can be implemented overnight. It requires careful planning, evaluation, and strategy. However, they believe that open source can play a significant role in most IT departments, and this book aims to provide the guidance and knowledge needed to make open source work.

In the acknowledgments section, the authors express their gratitude to several individuals who contributed to the book, including Dale Dougherty, the editor Andy Oram, and various industry experts who provided insights and reviews. The authors also dedicate the book to their loved ones who have supported and inspired them throughout the writing process.

Overall, "Open Source for the Enterprise" offers a comprehensive guide to open source adoption, providing IT professionals with the tools and knowledge needed to navigate the challenges and harness the benefits of open source software.
