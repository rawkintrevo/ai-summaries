Chapter 3 of the book "The Open Source Skill Set" discusses the skills needed to effectively use open source in an IT department. The chapter begins by emphasizing the importance of evaluating the maturity of an open source project before deciding to use it. The skill set required for using open source varies depending on the maturity of the project and the needs of the organization.

The chapter presents a proposed taxonomy of increasing skill levels for IT departments, inspired by Geoffrey Moore's analysis of technology adoption. The skill levels are beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert. Each skill level corresponds to a different set of skills and abilities.

At the beginner level, IT departments are able to use the most mature open source projects. They have a basic understanding of open source development tools, hosting capabilities, system administration, operations, open source infrastructure, programming languages, and open source community skills. They rely on precompiled binary versions and use hosting services provided by their IT department.

At the intermediate level, IT departments have a deeper understanding of open source development tools, hosting, system administration, operations, open source infrastructure, programming languages, and open source community skills. They are capable of compiling open source projects and have basic coding skills to write simple code for templates or configuration.

At the advanced level, IT departments have a comprehensive understanding of open source development tools, hosting, system administration, operations, open source infrastructure, programming languages, and open source community skills. They can recompile entire open source projects, monitor and optimize system performance, and have a deep knowledge of the open source infrastructure they are using.

At the expert level, IT departments are leaders in the open source community. They have expertise in open source development tools, hosting, system administration, operations, open source infrastructure, programming languages, and open source community skills. They can create new open source projects, lead existing projects, and have an extensive network of experts in the open source community.

The chapter also discusses the importance of communication and sales skills when advocating for the use of open source in an organization. Advocates should be able to make a case for the benefits of open source and the responsibilities involved.

The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of skill building and planning for the skills needed to support open source projects. It is crucial for IT departments to have the necessary skills to effectively evaluate, implement, and maintain open source projects. The chapter suggests that a gradual process of skill building is necessary and that IT departments should strive for a balance between in-house expertise and external support from consulting firms or service providers.

Overall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the skills needed to effectively use open source in an IT department. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the maturity of open source projects, evaluating the risks involved, and building the necessary skills to unlock the value of open source.
