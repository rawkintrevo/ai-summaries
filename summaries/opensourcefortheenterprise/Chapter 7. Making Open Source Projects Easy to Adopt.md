In Chapter 7 of the book "Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project", the authors discuss the importance of productization in open source projects and how it can benefit both the project itself and its users. Productization refers to the process of making an open source project easy to use, with features that automate common tasks and integrate well with other software.

The chapter begins by acknowledging that many open source projects lack productization, as project leaders often dismiss the need for it, assuming that users can figure out how to use the software themselves. However, the authors argue that investing in productization can significantly expand the user base and make the software more appealing to a wider audience.

Productization is not only beneficial for beginners and intermediate users who may struggle with the complexity of open source projects, but also for advanced users who can benefit from features that automate common operations and enhance integration with other systems. Additionally, productization can contribute to the revenue generation of a project, such as selling documentation or offering a fully productized commercial version.

For IT departments considering the use of open source software, this chapter emphasizes the importance of making their needs known to open source development teams and actively participating in the improvement of productization. By doing so, they can not only improve the software they are using but also create business opportunities for everyone involved in the project.

The chapter goes on to discuss various elements of productization that can make open source projects more user-friendly. These include providing basic information and community support, such as mission statements, working examples, and question-and-answer archives. Documentation is highlighted as an essential aspect of productization, with the authors acknowledging that it is often lacking in many projects. They emphasize the importance of providing step-by-step tutorials and well-maintained FAQs to help users understand and use the software effectively.

The authors also discuss the need for installation scripts, configuration tools, and administrative interfaces to make it easier for users to get started and manage the software. They recommend the inclusion of operational and diagnostic consoles to assist with software diagnosis and improve user experience.

In terms of advancing users' skills, the chapter suggests providing sample code and API documentation for intermediate and advanced users. It highlights the importance of architectural documentation and guides on embedded components to help users understand how the software works and how it can be extended or integrated into other applications.

The chapter concludes by discussing the benefits of increased adoption and the opportunities for skill building that productization can offer. It emphasizes the role of IT departments in contributing to open source projects and improving their own skills through involvement in productization and code contributions.

In summary, Chapter 7 emphasizes the importance of productization in open source projects and explains how it can benefit both the projects and their users. It provides guidance on various aspects of productization, from providing basic information and documentation to creating installation scripts and administrative interfaces. The chapter also highlights the opportunities for skill building and collaboration that arise from participating in productization efforts within open source projects.
