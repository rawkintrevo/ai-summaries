In Chapter 6 of the book "Producing Open Source Software" by Karl Fogel, the author discusses the different support models available for open source software. He starts by stating that while open source software comes with more responsibilities, it also brings more opportunities. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have recognized the potential of open source and are offering support services to bridge the skills gap required to take full advantage of open source.

The chapter explores the different support offers available on the market and how they appeal to IT departments at different skill levels. It begins by discussing the generic commercial software support offer, which provides access to a team of support professionals who help ensure that the software works as expected. Commercial support agreements also provide access to software updates and bug fixes. However, support is limited to specific versions of the software and might not cover older versions. There may also be disagreements between software vendors and IT departments about what constitutes a bug.

The chapter then moves on to evaluating open source support providers. Supporting open source software is the responsibility of the IT department, and there is no one else to blame if something goes wrong. This can be daunting for IT departments, especially those at beginner or intermediate levels. As open source becomes more critical to businesses, more IT departments will seek out support services.

The chapter discusses the different models of open source support, including subscriptions, certified bundles, custom enhancements, open source-based products, and consulting services. Subscriptions provide access to stable software with limited support, while certified bundles offer collections of software that work well together for specific purposes. Custom enhancements involve creating and supporting enhancements to open source projects, while open source-based products are commercial software built on open source foundations. Consulting services offer ongoing support for open source configurations created by systems integrators.

The chapter advises IT departments to carefully evaluate their support needs and the services offered by open source support providers. It also discusses the situations in which commercial open source support is most beneficial, such as when open source is mission-critical, when a certified bundle solves an important problem, when a consultant creates a custom feature, or when support is needed to accelerate implementation and build skills.

The author warns IT departments to buy carefully and test the offers provided by open source support providers. He also raises the possibility of a slowdown in the open source innovation cycle due to the arrival of commercial support providers who might want to maintain stability and restrain the costs of supporting a wide variety of bundles.

Overall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the different support models for open source software and offers guidance for IT departments on evaluating and choosing open source support vendors.
