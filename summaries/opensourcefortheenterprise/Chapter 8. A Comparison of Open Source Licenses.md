Chapter 8 of the book "Open Source for the Enterprise" provides a comprehensive analysis of open source licenses, starting with the legal underpinnings of open source software as embodied in the licenses created to protect and extend the aims of the software’s creators. The chapter goes on to discuss the different types of licenses, including the GPL, BSD, MIT, Apache, Artistic, Netscape Public License (NPL), Mozilla Public License (MPL), Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL), Apple Public Source License (APSL), IBM/Eclipse Public License (EPL), Lucent Public License (Plan 9), and other corporate licenses.

The chapter highlights that how much time an IT department must spend worrying about licenses depends on how open source will be used. For most CIOs and CTOs, who are interested in using open source software only to meet their day-to-day needs, there is little to be concerned about. However, for companies that are developing software that includes open source as components, it is critical to understand the aims and restrictions of these licenses.

It is stated that open source licenses have evolved into more than 50 “flavors” administrated by universities, individuals, and corporations including IBM, Apple, and Sun. The chapter explains that the casual use of the terms open source and free software has led to a popular, albeit hazy, impression that open source software exists in the public domain, or that the software’s creators have otherwise volunteered not to exercise their copyrights or to file for patents. The chapter clarifies that this misconception is born from another misconception: that open source advocates are anti-capitalist, anti-intellectual property zealots out to destroy the commercial software business.

The chapter delves into the details of the GPL, considered the progenitor of all open source licenses. It explains that Richard Stallman, who created the GPL for his GNU project, hates the term open source and demands the use of free software instead. The chapter highlights that the GPL has a notable restriction called Copyleft, which means any software developed from source code licensed under the GPL is also automatically bound by the GPL. This ensures that subsequent improvements to the software will be freely available and eliminates the possibility of forking due to commercialization.

Next, the chapter discusses the classic licenses, including the BSD and MIT licenses. It explains that the BSD and MIT licenses are considered permissive licenses, allowing users to build proprietary software using open source foundations without requiring the sharing of source code.

The chapter then moves on to the second generation/single-project licenses, such as the Apache license and the Artistic license. It explains that these licenses were created for specific projects and are generally not compatible with the GPL. However, they have become popular models for the creation of new licenses.

Lastly, the chapter discusses the corporate licenses, including the NPL, MPL, SISSL, APSL, EPL, and Plan 9 licenses. These licenses were developed by corporations to protect their intellectual property while still allowing for open source collaboration.

The chapter concludes by mentioning the dual licensing option, where companies offer the choice between a GPL option and a more conventional commercial license. This approach allows companies to reconcile the competing interests of open source developers and corporate customers.

Overall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of open source licenses, discussing their origins, aims, and restrictions, and highlighting the different licenses available to developers and organizations.
