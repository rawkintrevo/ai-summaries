Chapter 4 of the book "Open Source Success" discusses the importance of conducting a return on investment (ROI) analysis for open source projects. The chapter starts by highlighting the challenges of creating a defensible ROI approach, including the difficulty of adjusting assumptions and undervaluing intangible benefits. However, it emphasizes that ROI is necessary for open source projects and provides a guide for conducting an ROI analysis.

The chapter explains that ROI analysis is often requested by management to determine if an open source project will help increase revenue or save money for the organization. It acknowledges that ROI analysis can be difficult to create, particularly as intangible benefits and estimated revenue increases are challenging to accurately quantify. Despite these challenges, the chapter stresses that open source projects cannot be given a pass without an ROI analysis.

The chapter also discusses the different fashions of ROI analysis, highlighting that the need for ROI fluctuates depending on the business environment. During boom times, ROI may be less scrutinized as businesses focus on quick execution of strategies. However, during tougher times, ROI becomes more important, with CFOs playing a crucial role in determining IT investments. The chapter also cautions against relying too heavily on vendor-driven ROI studies, noting the bias that may be present in these studies.

The chapter then delves into the specifics of calculating ROI for open source. It explains that the calculation is similar to that of commercial software, with considerations such as time horizon, alternative comparisons, interest rates, and cost inclusions. However, it highlights that the costs of open source differ from those of commercial software. It explores various cost components, including evaluation costs, license and maintenance costs, installation and configuration costs, integration and customization costs, and operations and support costs.

The chapter emphasizes that evaluation costs for open source projects can be higher and require different resources compared to commercial software. It outlines the tasks involved in evaluating an open source project, such as searching for open source options, creating test environments, installing and configuring the software, and researching integration techniques. It also discusses the costs associated with installation and configuration, including engineer time for learning how to install and operate the software, performance testing, and training.

Next, the chapter delves into integration and customization costs, which involve planning, designing, and developing to integrate the software into an organization and extend its functionality. It highlights the importance of gathering requirements, understanding the software's workings, designing and coding the integration, and testing the customization. The chapter also mentions the potential need for external consultants.

The chapter then discusses operations and support costs, which are similar to those incurred for commercial software. It mentions hardware costs, rack space, electric power, network bandwidth, operational monitoring, and backups as some elements of these costs.

Lastly, the chapter emphasizes the importance of skills development in open source projects, as investing in open source also means investing in increasing an IT department's skill level. It suggests that as skills grow, more open source projects become usable, and organizations can focus on prioritizing projects that provide the most benefit.

In summary, Chapter 4 of "Open Source Success" provides a comprehensive overview of conducting an ROI analysis for open source projects. It highlights the importance of ROI analysis, discusses the challenges and fashions of ROI, delves into the different cost components, and emphasizes the role of skills development in open source projects.
