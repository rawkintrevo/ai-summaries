In this text, the author discusses the experience of feeling overwhelmed by life and the patterns of thinking that can contribute to this feeling. They describe a character named Marissa who, despite practicing mindfulness, still finds herself experiencing moments of tiredness, anger, and sadness. Marissa realizes that these patterns of thinking are damaging and often lead her to believe that things will never get better. However, she learns to recognize these patterns and remind herself that her current state is temporary, and that she can take action to take care of herself during these low periods.
One of the techniques Marissa uses is taking a breathing space, where she focuses her attention on her body and uses this wider perspective to become aware of her thoughts and the actions she can take to better care for herself. The author emphasizes the importance of being fully present in everyday life and encourages the reader to take moments of pause and notice what is happening in the present moment.
The text then transitions into a story about a king who needs to move his palace and the trusted general who helps him. The general is rewarded with his freedom and wealth, and experiences a moment of completeness and satisfaction. This story is used to illustrate the idea that in our busy lives, we often overlook the small moments of completion and rush from task to task without taking time to appreciate what we have accomplished. The author suggests that cultivating a sense of completeness, even in small moments, can help us cope with the constant thoughts and feelings of not being good enough.
The author then describes the aim and structure of the mindfulness program. They explain that the early sessions focused on recognizing the "Doing" mode of mind and cultivating the alternative "Being" mode through sustained attention and focus on simple things like taste, sensations, and breath. The goal was to learn to pay intentional attention with kindness and without judgment. The later sessions focused on recognizing when stress triggers the Doing mode and learning to disengage from it and enter the Being mode. The aim was to respond more skillfully to overwhelming moments and cultivate kindness towards oneself and others.
Next, the author discusses the benefits of mindfulness and how it can help us deal with stress, anxiety, and exhaustion. They explain that mindfulness is not a self-help approach or a technique for correcting negative thinking, but rather a way of bringing awareness to our underlying patterns and driving forces. Through mindfulness, we can dissolve these negative patterns and strive for a more present and whole life. The author notes that while they can provide scientific evidence to support the benefits of mindfulness, it ultimately needs to be experienced firsthand to be fully understood.
The author then encourages the reader to live their life to the fullest in the present moment, rather than constantly postponing their happiness and fulfillment. They emphasize that mindfulness is about becoming fully aware of the life we already have, rather than the life we wish we had. They stress the importance of practicing mindfulness daily and maintaining a routine that is sustainable in the long term. The author offers various tips for integrating mindfulness into everyday life, such as starting the day with mindfulness, using breathing spaces to punctuate the day, maintaining formal meditation practice, befriending one's feelings, engaging in mindful activities, and increasing exercise.
Finally, the author reminds the reader that the choice of practice and practice length is up to them and encourages experimenting with what feels right and nourishing. They emphasize the importance of daily practice and using the breathing space as a tool for checking in with oneself throughout the day. The author advises practicing as if one's life depended on it, as mindfulness can help individuals live a more meaningful and fulfilled life. They end with a poem by Roger Keyes that emphasizes the importance of caring, feeling, and noticing in life.
