Scientific research using brain imaging has shown that mindfulness meditation has positive effects on the brain. Through brain imaging techniques such as fMRI, researchers have observed the parts of the brain associated with positive emotions such as happiness, empathy, and compassion becoming stronger and more active as people engage in mindfulness meditation. This suggests that mindfulness meditation can lead to a reduction in unhappiness, anxiety, and stress, and increase feelings of reinvigoration.

In the past, it was believed that individuals had a set emotional set-point that determined their overall level of happiness. However, recent research has challenged this idea. Studies by Richard Davidson and Jon Kabat-Zinn have shown that mindfulness training can enable individuals to escape the gravitational pull of their emotional set-point and permanently alter their underlying level of happiness for the better.

The research conducted by Davidson and Kabat-Zinn involved using brain imaging to measure electrical activity in different parts of the brain. They found that when people are emotionally upset, a part of the brain called the right prefrontal cortex lights up more than the left. Conversely, when people are in a positive mood, the left prefrontal cortex lights up more than the right. This led to the development of a "mood index" based on the ratio between the electrical activity in the left and right prefrontal cortices. This ratio can predict daily moods with great accuracy. Mindfulness training was found to shift this ratio to the left, leading to increased happiness, reduced stress levels, and changes in the way the brain works.

Furthermore, research by Dr. Sarah Lazar found that long-term meditation can actually change the physical structure of the brain itself. The emotional thermostat is reset for the better, leading to increased happiness, ease, and energy. These changes are particularly pronounced in a part of the brain called the insula, which is integral to our sense of human connection and empathy.

Mindfulness meditation has also been found to have numerous benefits for mental and physical health. Studies have shown that mindfulness training focusing on loving-kindness for oneself and others can lead to increased positive emotions and a greater sense of purpose in life. Mindfulness has also been found to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and preventing relapse in those who have experienced multiple episodes of depression. In addition, mindfulness meditation has been found to boost resilience, enhance hardiness, and have a positive effect on physical health.

Overall, the research suggests that mindfulness meditation can have profound effects on the brain and translate into benefits for overall well-being. The practice of mindfulness can enhance happiness, well-being, resilience, and physical health. The benefits can be experienced through daily practice over a period of eight weeks. The remaining chapters in the book provide a guided eight-week program to develop mindfulness skills and integrate mindfulness into daily life.
