In the second week of the course, participants often struggle with the idea that meditation should clear their minds of all thoughts. They may experience restlessness, difficulty focusing, or a constant stream of thoughts during meditation. However, it is important to understand that the enjoyment of the practice does not necessarily correlate with its long-term benefits. This is because meditation requires training the mind to focus and concentrate, much like exercising a muscle that has been underused. Restlessness, boredom, and mind-wandering are actually opportunities for the mind to strengthen its attention and awareness. By acknowledging these distractions and gently redirecting the mind back to the point of focus, participants can enhance their concentration.

During the Body Scan meditation, some individuals may find it challenging to feel sensations in certain parts of their bodies. This is normal and to be expected. It may take time for individuals to reconnect fully with their bodies and sense the subtle sensations within. Participants are encouraged to continue practicing the meditation and to imagine themselves as naturalists patiently waiting for a shy animal to appear. Eventually, they may start to notice fleeting sensations in the body, and with time, they will be able to sense more and more of their bodies.

It is common for the mind to become restless, agitated, or bored during meditation. However, repeated practice with the Body Scan can teach individuals to accept these experiences as part of an old habit of perceiving everything as a threat or challenge. By exploring these experiences with openness and curiosity, participants can learn to be with agitation rather than trying to push it away. If sleepiness occurs during the meditation, it is typically a result of being tired from long working hours or lack of sleep at night. Participants are encouraged to simply continue where they left off after awakening and not be too hard on themselves. By avoiding self-criticism and guilt, participants can maintain enthusiasm for future meditation sessions.

The Body Scan is an important practice because it helps individuals recognize the characteristics of the "Doing" mode of mind, which is the mode that keeps people stuck in relentless busyness. The Doing mode is characterized by judging, comparing, living in the past or future, and avoiding what is disliked. By practicing the Body Scan, individuals can become aware of when the Doing mode shows up and tries to take over. This awareness allows them to shift from the Doing mode to the "Being" mode, where they can directly experience themselves and the world with openness and curiosity.

In addition to the Body Scan, participants are encouraged to engage in mindful walking as a form of exercise and stress relief. Mindful walking involves paying attention to the sensations in the feet and legs, as well as the sights, sounds, and smells in the environment. It is an opportunity to be fully present in the moment and appreciate the sensory delights of each step. Going for a walk mindfully can have transformative effects on one's mindset and overall well-being.

To enhance appreciation for the present moment, participants are advised to give extra attention to simple, daily activities and spontaneous events. They are also encouraged to engage in the ten-finger gratitude exercise, where they bring to mind ten things they are grateful for each day. This exercise helps individuals appreciate the small things in life and cultivate a positive outlook.

Week Three of the mindfulness program focuses on further enhancing awareness of the body and mind. It emphasizes the importance of pausing and waiting rather than constantly pushing and pulling in one direction. The negative mindset of feeling trapped and the aversion system it activates can lead to exhaustion, helplessness, and a narrowed focus. By becoming aware of these patterns and turning toward them, individuals can dissolve them and experience true freedom.

Overall, the second week of the mindfulness course introduces participants to the challenges and rewards of meditation, and encourages them to cultivate a curious and open mindset. It emphasizes the importance of patience, self-acceptance, and appreciation for the present moment. By practicing the Body Scan, mindful walking, and gratitude, individuals can develop greater awareness and resilience in their daily lives.
