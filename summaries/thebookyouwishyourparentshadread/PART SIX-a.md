The author discusses the importance of understanding behavior as a form of communication, especially in children. They emphasize the role of the parent in modeling appropriate behavior and being a positive influence on their child. The author emphasizes the need for parents to consider their child's feelings and not dismiss them as silly or wrong. They also stress the importance of setting boundaries and maintaining a balance between being strict and being lax.

The author discusses the role of role models in a child's behavior and emphasizes the impact that parents have on their child's behavior. They encourage parents to be respectful and considerate towards their children and others, as this sets an example for how children should behave. The author also acknowledges that children may not always behave well and may act out due to frustration or the inability to effectively communicate their feelings and needs.

The author introduces the concept of the "winning-and-losing game" and discusses how parents should aim to collaborate with their children rather than engage in a power struggle. They emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying feelings and needs behind a child's behavior and helping them find alternative, more convenient ways of expressing themselves. The author suggests that labeling behavior as "good" or "bad" is not helpful, and instead encourages parents to approach behavior as simply being more or less convenient.

The author also discusses the importance of understanding a child's developmental stage and individual differences. They emphasize the need for parents to develop skills such as tolerance for frustration, flexibility, problem-solving skills, and the ability to see and feel things from other people's point of view. The author acknowledges that these skills develop at different rates in each child and that it is important for parents to be patient and supportive as their child learns and grows.

The author addresses the issue of whining, tantrums, and other inconvenient behaviors and suggests that these behaviors are often a form of communication for children who have not yet developed the skills to express themselves effectively. They encourage parents to validate their child's feelings and help them find more appropriate ways of expressing themselves. The author also discusses the potential impact of past experiences on a child's behavior and emphasizes the need for parents to be understanding and supportive.

Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of positive and respectful parenting, understanding a child's feelings and needs, and helping children develop the skills to behave conveniently and express themselves effectively.
