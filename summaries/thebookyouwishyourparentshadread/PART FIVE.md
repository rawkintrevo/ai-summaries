In this section, the author discusses the importance of a strong bond between parent and child for good mental health. They emphasize the need for parents to be emotionally close to their child, and to engage in mutual influence and turn-taking communication. The author suggests that babies communicate through noises, gestures, and turn-taking games, and it is important for parents to respond to these forms of communication to develop a strong bond. They discourage the use of techniques, such as sleep training or leaving a child to cry, that may interrupt the natural process of mutual communication and bonding.

The author also addresses the issue of sleep and suggests a method called sleep nudging as an alternative to sleep training. Sleep nudging involves gradually moving a child away from their comfort baseline in terms of sleep conditions, while still ensuring they feel safe and secure. The author advises against sleep training, as it may cause the child to feel abandoned and have negative effects on brain development. They emphasize the importance of babies feeling secure and comforted during sleep.

The author further discusses the value of play in a child's development. They emphasize the importance of allowing children to lead in play and to engage in unstructured, imaginative play. They suggest that excessive toys may overwhelm children and hinder their ability to engage deeply with an activity. The author also mentions the benefits of age-mixed play and the need for children to have multi-aged playmates to learn from and be role models for each other.

In summary, the author emphasizes the significance of a strong bond between parent and child, the importance of responding to a child's communication and needs, and the value of play in a child's development. They discourage techniques that interrupt the natural process of bonding and communication, such as sleep training, and encourage parents to engage in empathetic and respectful parenting practices.
