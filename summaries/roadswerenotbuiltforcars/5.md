In this chapter, the author discusses the history and impact of the "Good Roads" movement, which aimed to improve the quality of roads in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The movement was actually started by cyclists, who were wealthy and influential individuals at the time. These cyclists later became motorists and continued to campaign for better roads. The author explains that the first automobiles relied heavily on technologies developed by the cycling industry, which was at the forefront of industrial design and manufacturing processes. 

The roads in the 19th century were often in poor condition, with country roads being rutted, dusty, and muddy. Urban areas fared slightly better with macadam roads, and some major thoroughfares in cities were even topped with wood. However, these roads were not ideal and often needed improvement. Cyclists recognized the need for better roads and advocated for their improvement. They believed that smooth and hard roads would make cycling easier and more enjoyable. 

In the late 1880s, wealthy cyclists launched a highways improvement campaign known as the Good Roads movement. They successfully lobbied for federal funding for roads and the development of a national plan. In 1916, the Federal Aid Road Act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson, providing further funding for road improvements. By this time, the Good Roads movement was led by motorists, but many of these individuals had been involved in cycling previously. 

The author argues that the contribution of cyclists to the improvement of roads has been obscured over time. The Ford Motor Company, for example, claimed that they started the movement for good roads, but this claim was later proven false. The author highlights the important role that cyclists played in the roads improvement movement and criticizes the erasure of their contribution. 

The author also discusses the impact of cycling on society, particularly for women and the working class. Cycling played a vital role in women's emancipation, providing them with increased mobility and independence. It also provided economic opportunities for workers and had an impact on equal rights for women. 

The author challenges the common perception that cyclists and motorists of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras were from different classes. They demonstrate that many cyclists later became motorists and that the two groups often intersected. The author argues that this "two tribes" concept is incorrect and that early motorists celebrated their cycling backgrounds. 

The chapter concludes by questioning the dominance of the automobile and the idea that it will continue to marginalize other road users. The author suggests that this trajectory may not continue and that cycling and other forms of transport may play a greater role in the future.
