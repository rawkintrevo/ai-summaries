In the late 19th century, the "Good Roads" movement in the United States was led by cyclists, not motorists as is commonly believed. Cyclists were instrumental in advocating for better road conditions and infrastructure, recognizing the importance of smooth and well-maintained roads for their own enjoyment and safety. Bicycles were at the forefront of technological advancements, and many early automobiles relied on technologies developed by the cycling industry. The Good Roads movement, which began in the 1880s, was initiated by wealthy and influential cyclists who later transitioned into motorists. 

At the time, many country roads were in poor condition, often becoming muddy and rutted in bad weather. Urban areas fared better with an experimental use of asphalt roads in cities such as Washington, D.C. Asphalte roads quickly gained popularity among cyclists, and they soon became advocates for improved road infrastructure. The Good Roads movement gained momentum and eventually led to federal funding for road improvements and the development of the American highway system. 

The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, signed by President Woodrow Wilson, was a significant milestone for the Good Roads movement. Wilson himself had spent time in Europe, where he witnessed the superiority of European roads, and he became an advocate for improved road conditions. During this time, cycling's influence on road improvements began to fade as the movement shifted its focus to motorists. However, it is important to note that many of the early motoring officials, promoters, and manufacturers were also involved in cycling. 

Despite the significant contributions of cyclists to the development of roads, their role has been largely ignored or downplayed in history. The Ford Motor Company, for example, falsely claimed in 1927 to have started the movement for good roads. Historians and social commentators have perpetuated the idea that cyclists and motorists belonged to different classes, but this is not accurate. In fact, many early motorists were avid cyclists and carried their cycling backgrounds into their advocacy for better roads. 

The influence of cycling on road history began to be obscured in the early 20th century, as cycling became associated with the working class and motoring was seen as modern and progressive. Cycling had an elitist and sometimes divisive past, but it also provided economic opportunities for workers and played a significant role in women's emancipation. Additionally, cyclists were instrumental in shifting public opinion and gaining support for improved roads. 

The contribution of cycling to the development of roads and automobiles has been largely overlooked due to societal prejudices against cycling and a focus on motorized transportation. However, it is important to recognize the impact that cyclists had on road improvements and the historical significance of the bicycle as a catalyst for change. The early cyclists who advocated for better roads laid the foundation for the modern transportation infrastructure we have today.
