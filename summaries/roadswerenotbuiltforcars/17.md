In the late 19th century, the Ripley Road in Surrey, England, was a popular destination for cyclists. It was known as the "Mecca of all good cyclists" and attracted riders from all over the world. The road was particularly famous among American cyclists, who would include a trip to Ripley in their itinerary when visiting England. The popularity of the Ripley Road can be seen in the sheer number of cyclists passing through on Whit Sunday in 1894, with the police in Kingston upon Thames reporting 20,000 cyclists on that day alone. The road gained a reputation for its beauty and charm, with its scenic countryside, Regency pleasure grounds, and historical sites like the Anchor inn. The road was also known for its speed, with certain stretches being ideal for fast riding. The Ripley Road played a significant role in the revival of long-neglected roads, as cyclists brought life back to these routes. It also had a positive impact on coaching inns and hotels along the road, as cyclists became their new clientele. The Anchor inn in Ripley became a favorite among cyclists, offering accommodation and meals to the riders. The inn was run by the Dibble family, and their daughter Annie became particularly famous for her hospitality and service to cyclists. The Ripley Road and the Anchor inn were romanticized in literature and popular imagination, and they attracted cyclist gatherings and events. The popularity of cycling on the Ripley Road began to decline in the early 20th century with the arrival of motor cars, which led to increased traffic and dust. The road became less inviting to cyclists, and the cycling boom of the late 19th century gradually faded. Today, the Ripley Road is no longer a popular destination for cyclists, but it still holds historical significance as a once-famous cycling route.
