The push for improved roads in America began in the 1880s, started by cyclists who wanted smoother roads for their bicycles. However, Henry Ford and other automobile manufacturers later claimed credit for starting the Good Roads movement. In truth, the movement started with cyclists years before the first motor car was introduced in America. Ford's false claims were spread by press officers and advertising copywriters who deliberately ignored the contributions made by cyclists. Ford's Model T, while one of the pioneering motor cars, was not the first on American soil, nor was there no market for motor cars before the Model T's launch. The movement for Good Roads was started by cyclists, including the League of American Wheelmen (L.A.W.), which had committees in every state, published a Good Roads magazine, and was the driving force behind the movement.

Cyclists played a significant role in advocating for better roads in America. They surveyed roads, raised awareness of the poor road conditions, and built relationships with other groups, including farmers, the postal service, and railroad companies, to showcase the benefits of improved roads. The L.A.W. successfully lobbied for state highway commissions and state aid for roads, leading to rapid improvements in road infrastructure in states like New York and Michigan.

In 1893, the L.A.W. created the Office of Road Inquiry, which eventually became the Federal Highway Administration. This federal involvement in road improvement was largely due to the efforts of cyclists. The L.A.W. also founded the American Association for Highway Improvement, which brought together various stakeholders to promote road improvement.

However, as the automobile industry grew, motor interests started to overshadow the contributions of cyclists. The L.A.W. eventually faded away, and automobile manufacturers took credit for the Good Roads movement. The motor-dominated roads lobby pushed for wider roads and the creation of the Interstate highway system in the 1920s.

Despite the attempts to diminish their contributions, cyclists were instrumental in starting and advocating for better road infrastructure in America. They played a crucial role in raising awareness, lobbying for state and federal aid, and promoting the importance of good roads. Their efforts laid the foundation for the development of the modern road system in the United States.
