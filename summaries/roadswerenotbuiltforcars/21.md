The chapter discusses the strong connection between cyclists and early motorists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many pioneering motorists were former champion cyclists, bicycle manufacturing company owners, or cycling journalists. Cycling played a vital role in the development of motoring, with bicycles and cars overlapping in terms of technology and the people involved. However, by the end of the 1920s, the contribution of cycling to motoring was suppressed due to the proletarian image of cycling. 

The chapter highlights that cycling and motoring were not exclusive to different social classes. Many early motorists were from the same social class as cyclists, with some even coming from aristocratic backgrounds. Some historians have mistakenly assumed that motorists of the time were from a higher class, but this is not accurate. In fact, cycling lobbyists were influential members of the nascent motor lobby. Many key pioneers in the field of motoring were members of cycling organizations and were involved in the organization of cycling events.

The chapter also notes the pioneering role of bicycles in the development of motor cars. The first motor car, made by Carl Benz in Germany in 1885, used cycle technology developed by John Kemp Starley's uncle. The bicycle had a significant influence on the introduction and acceptance of automobiles.

The chapter mentions notable individuals who were both cyclists and motorists, such as Thomas F. Dunn, president of the Pennsylvania Automotive Association, who stated that many motor car sales in the US in 1899 were made to cyclists. It also discusses the interconnectedness of the cycling and motoring communities, with many early motorists knowing each other from their cycling days.

The chapter challenges the prevailing belief that early motorists were from a higher social class than cyclists. It provides examples of high-status individuals, such as Edith Wharton and Woodrow Wilson, who were both cycling enthusiasts before becoming involved in motoring. It suggests that this belief may have been developed from the 1920s onward when cycling had become associated with the working class.

The chapter also explores the geographical connections between cycling and motoring. For example, Detroit, which later became the center of the automobile industry, was initially a center for bicycle production and the incubation of leaders in the Good Roads movement. The Midlands in England, where many bicycle manufacturers were located, also became a hub for motor manufacturing.

The chapter concludes by discussing the importance of cycling in the early stages of motoring. Many motor pioneers continued to cycle after becoming involved in the automobile industry, and some even preferred cycling over driving. The chapter suggests that the close connection between cycling and motoring in the early years has been overlooked by historians and highlights the significant role of cycling in the history of highways and motoring.
