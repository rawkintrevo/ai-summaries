The epilogue begins by quoting President Ronald Reagan, highlighting the excitement and wonder of the modern world. The author then ponders what H.G. Wells, if he had a time machine, would think about the survival of cycling in today's society. Cycling would likely surprise him, but he would also find it normal that dentists, doctors, and brain surgeons would spend so much money on fancy bicycles. He would be shocked at the number of people on low incomes who spend a significant portion of their money on cars they can't afford. The author suggests that the mainstream desire for motorized transportation is driven by status, convenience, comfort, and pleasure, but also points out that roads were specifically built for cars.

The author references Susan Jeune, Baroness St. Helier, who predicted in 1895 that when cars became cheap enough, everyone would own them, leading to the invasion of the countryside and the potential for disastrous results. She believed that the roads would no longer be controlled by the wealthy elite, but would belong to the general public. The author contends that her prediction has come true, as society has become dependent on automobiles, and roads have been retrofitted for motorized vehicles.

The next section of the epilogue is a quote from Arthur Roy Du Cros in 1938, who believes that the pneumatic tyre, like other inventions, has both good and evil aspects. He argues that the tyre has changed the tempo of human existence and led to the desecration of rural areas and a high mortality rate on the roads.

The author then brings up his own worries about a car-dependent society leading to gridlock, obesity, and climate change. He quotes William Clay Ford Jr., the great grandson of Detroit's most famous cyclist, who warns that the current mobility model will not work as the population continues to grow and more cars are added to the road. Ford argues that the solution is not more cars or more roads, but rather a flexible infrastructure designed for the future.

The epilogue concludes with acknowledgements from the author, thanking his family, copy-editor, beta readers, and individuals who helped with research and translation. He also expresses gratitude to various libraries and historical associations for their assistance.

The appendix provides a timeline of the history of roads, starting in 700 B.C. with the use of bitumen and brick for a processional road in Assur. It includes key milestones such as the construction of the Appian Way in 312 B.C., the introduction of toll roads in England in 1663, the patenting of the pneumatic tyre in 1888, and the creation of the National Cyclists' Union in 1878.

Overall, the epilogue reflects on the past, present, and future of transportation, highlighting the impact of cars on society and the potential need for new infrastructure to accommodate future mobility needs.
