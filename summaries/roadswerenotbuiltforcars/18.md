The push to pave America’s roads began in the 1880s with cyclists who wanted smoother roads. The Good Roads movement gained momentum before the introduction of motor cars. However, in 1927, Henry Ford falsely claimed that his Model T started the movement for good roads. The truth is, the Model T was one of many pioneer motor cars, and the market for motor cars existed long before its launch. The movement for Good Roads actually began with cyclists several years before the first motor car in America. The Ford Motor Company intentionally erased the heavy lifting done by cyclists in promoting good roads and rewrote history to give credit to Henry Ford and his Model T. This false claim was repeated by other automobile manufacturers as well. John Jakob Raskob, the chief accountant at General Motors, also claimed that the automobile had started the movement for good roads. However, this claim was debunked by Christy Borth, director of the Automobile Manufacturers’ Association and a highway historian, who stated that the push for good roads originated with early automobile clubs, predating Ford’s announcement. In response to Ford’s false claims, Richie G. Betts, the editor of Bicycling World in the 1890s, complained that the movement for good roads actually began with cyclists. The original Good Roads movement was largely funded from Hartford, Connecticut, the home city of the Columbia-brand bicycle. The Ford Motor Company’s false claims met with little dissent in 1927, although Frank Parker Stockbridge, a writer, and cyclist, emphasized that Henry Ford was not the “Father of Good Roads” and credited Amos G. Batchelder, the executive secretary of the American Automobile Association, with starting the movement. The push for good roads had gained traction before Ford’s claims, and Batchelder had earlier been an official with the League of American Wheelmen, a cyclist organization. The early motor car manufacturers’ false claims about the Good Roads movement ignored the fact that cyclists had started the push for well-maintained roads. George E. Walsh, a regular contributor to America’s The Automobile magazine in 1902, acknowledged that the bicycle had a profound effect on road improvement in the past decade. The bicycle attracted capital investments to road construction and spread knowledge about road construction methods. Cyclists used their intimate knowledge of road conditions to conduct surveys and advocate for better roads, and the League of American Wheelmen (L.A.W.), founded in 1880, played a significant role in educating and agitating for improved road conditions. The L.A.W. became a well-organized political body that sought to promote the general interests of cycling and secure improvement in the condition of public roads. The L.A.W. newsletters and pamphlets educated cyclists about road maintenance and regulations, and the organization developed strong relationships with government officials, farmers’ organizations, railroad companies, and postal services to build a coalition in support of good roads. The L.A.W. also created the American Association for Highway Improvement in 1901 to bring together various interests in the Good Roads movement, including farmers, postal services, railroad companies, and fledgling automobile manufacturers. The L.A.W. worked to gain state and federal aid for road improvements and played a vital role in the creation of state highway commissions in the 1890s. The L.A.W. published textbooks on road construction and distributed them to legislators and government officials and also organized conferences, conventions, and meetings to promote the Good Roads movement. The L.A.W. even funded and supported the Office of Road Inquiry, which was renamed the Office of Public Roads in 1905. The accomplishments of the L.A.W. laid the foundation for the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 and eventually the construction of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways in the 1950s. Despite the efforts of the L.A.W., automobile interests eventually took credit for starting the Good Roads movement, but the cyclists who laid the groundwork for road improvements should not be dismissed. They were the ones who first advocated for and agitated for the construction of better roads, paving the way for modern transportation infrastructure in America.
