This chapter discusses the history of roads and how they have evolved over time. The author points out that roads have always been important for communication, commerce, and transportation. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that railways would dominate and roads would become irrelevant. The author emphasizes that roads did not just appear recently; most roads have a long and rich history, shaped by ancient civilizations and indigenous populations. For example, many modern roads in North America were originally created by Native Americans as trading or hunting trails. In more recent times, cities around the world are starting to realize that they have built too many roads, especially in the mid-20th century when motorways were seen as the future. As a result, some cities are demolishing or remodeling urban motorways to create more people-friendly spaces. The chapter also highlights the importance of road drainage and the role of different road engineers in improving road surfaces throughout history. Furthermore, the chapter discusses the initial resistance to motor cars, particularly from farmers and rural communities who saw them as a threat. The author argues that the dominance of motor cars and the motor-centric mindset is not necessarily permanent, and that there could come a time when motor cars are considered historically quaint like steam trains. The chapter concludes by noting that roads are increasingly seen as congestion-inducing and environmentally detrimental, leading to a growing movement to promote alternative forms of transportation and rethink the design and use of roads.
