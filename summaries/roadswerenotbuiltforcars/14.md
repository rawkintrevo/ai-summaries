The chapter starts by highlighting the issue of providing segregated cycle lanes in London due to the lack of space. It then goes on to discuss the increase in size and weight of modern cars compared to their earlier counterparts. This increase in size is attributed to factors such as airbags, crumple zones, and consumer preferences for larger vehicles. The chapter argues that the wider roads being demanded to accommodate these larger cars are a result of an "arms race" in motor vehicle size.

The chapter goes on to discuss the historical development of roads in Britain, emphasizing that many roads were not originally designed for motor cars. It notes that many wide roads in London, such as the New Road (now Marylebone, Euston, and Pentonville roads), were built for other purposes, such as transporting animals to the Smithfield meat market. It also mentions that some wide roads, like Portland Place, were built for aesthetic and vista-promoting purposes.

The chapter then provides evidence that many of London's major roads have been wide for centuries, contrary to popular belief. It cites historical maps and illustrations that show wide roads like Holborn, Cheapside, and Fleet Street. The chapter argues that the perception of London as having narrow roads is due to congestion rather than actual road width.

The chapter continues with examples of wide roads in other cities and countries. It mentions the wide roads laid out in Melbourne, Australia, in the 1830s, and the wide streets planned by Joseph Smith and Brigham Young for Mormon settlements in the United States. It also discusses the wide boulevards of Paris, which were designed for military and crowd control purposes by Baron Haussmann in the 1850s.

The chapter then briefly touches on the failure of motor cars to alleviate congestion, despite early hopes that they would. It quotes from various sources, including H.G. Wells and Lewis Mumford, who predicted that motor cars would only exacerbate the problem. The chapter concludes with the statement that despite having many wide roads, the problem of congestion still exists due to the "greedy appetite" for car use.

Overall, the chapter argues that wider roads are not necessarily a solution to congestion and that many wide roads were not originally designed for motor cars. It challenges the perception that London's roads are narrow and medieval and provides historical evidence to support its claims.
