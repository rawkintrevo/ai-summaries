The Ripley Road in Surrey, England, was a popular destination for cyclists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Located just ten miles from London, the 10-mile stretch between the Angel Inn at Thames Ditton and the Anchor Hotel at Ripley was frequented by cyclists of all kinds. The road became famous among cyclists across the globe, with American cyclists in particular making it a must-do on their itineraries. The road was known as the "Mecca of all good cyclists" and attracted thousands of cyclists on Whit Sunday in 1894 alone.

The Ripley Road gained popularity thanks to the rise of bicycles, which revitalized long-neglected roads. Prior to the coming of the railways, the road had been a major route for stagecoaches carrying sailors on leave to the chief naval seaport in Portsmouth. However, with the advent of the railways, the stagecoach trade waned, and towns like Ripley were bypassed. Bicycles revived these forgotten roads, and coaching inns like the Anchor at Ripley welcomed the new cycling trade.

The road itself was scenic and charming, passing through Regency pleasure grounds and countryside dotted with clumps of Surrey pines. The road was loved not just for its beauty, but also for the Anchor Inn, a 16th-century almshouse turned inn. The inn was run by the resourceful widow Mrs. Dibble and her daughters, who catered to the needs of cyclists. The Anchor became a popular destination for cyclists, offering a nostalgic and rustic experience in contrast to the city.

The Ripley Road attracted a wide range of cyclists, from professionals to leisure riders. Many influential figures in the cycling and motor industries cycled along the road, and years later, nostalgic reunions were held at the Anchor. The road became a symbol of the golden age of cycling, inspiring poets and authors alike. The road also had historical significance, with landmarks like Claremont and Painshill Gardens situated nearby.

The popularity of the Ripley Road among cyclists declined with the rise of motor vehicles. The road became congested with dust clouds and forced cyclists off the road. In the 1970s, a bypass was built, relegating Ripley to a backwater. Today, parts of the road remain recognizable to cyclists, but it has lost its former charm and is characterized by a narrow and poorly-maintained cycleway.

Overall, the Ripley Road was once a thriving hub for cyclists, attracting visitors from around the world. Its scenic beauty, historical significance, and the hospitality of the Anchor Inn made it a must-visit destination for cyclists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
