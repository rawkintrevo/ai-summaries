In this book, the author discusses the use of the terms "car" and "automobile" interchangeably. They explain that in Britain, the term "automobile" is not commonly used and is associated with American English. However, the word was once used regularly in Britain, as evidenced by the founding of the Royal Automobile Club in London in 1897. The author discusses the origins of the word "automobile," which is a Latin and Greek mash-up that originated in France in the 1890s. French engineers, using German engines, dominated the global market for automobiles until the late 1890s, leading to French words like "chassis," "garage," "carburettor," and "chauffeur" becoming prevalent in the automotive industry.

The author also delves into the various competing names for the motor car in the late 19th century. Names such as "autocar," "bicycle," "machine," and "greaser" were suggested, but ultimately the term "automobile" gained popularity, particularly in Britain with the influence of magazines like The Autocar. The author quotes an editorial from The New York Times that acknowledges the awkwardness of the word "automobile" and its half Greek-half Latin origin.

The book also explores the history of the bicycle and the various names used for it. The author explains that the term "wheel" was commonly used in America, even though bicycles are composed of two wheels. This is because the first mainstream bicycle was a high-wheeler with a prominent front wheel and a tiny trailing wheel. The author notes that the term "bicycle" dates back to at least 1828 when a horse-drawn cabriolet was described as such. The author explores the different names for the bicycle in other languages, such as the Polish word "rower" and the French word "v√©lo."

The book primarily focuses on the period from 1868 to 1896, which saw the introduction and booming popularity of bicycles. It also discusses the transition from bicycles to automobiles and how cycling became associated with the working class. The author dissects the differences between British and American English, particularly in terms of spelling and measurements. They highlight the use of terms like "pavement" and "sidewalk," "cycle path" and "cycleway," and "asphalt" and "asphalte." The book also includes information on setts, cobbles, and the differences between the two.

The author emphasizes the importance of citing sources and includes online notes for further reference. They acknowledge that while not everything has a cycling-related backstory, there is significant evidence to be explored and uncovered. The book ends with a discussion of the dominance of bicycles and the resurrection of lost or obscured histories related to cycling.
