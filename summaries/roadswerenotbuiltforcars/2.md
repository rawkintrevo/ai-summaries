The author of this book explores the history of bicycles and automobiles, focusing on the terminology and language used to describe these modes of transport. The author discusses the interchangeable use of terms such as "motor car" and "automobile" and how the word "car" used to refer to trains or trams in the 19th century. The author also highlights the American influence on the use of "automobile" and "auto" as these terms are not commonly used in everyday British English.

The author explains that the first mass-market sales and promotions of automobiles occurred in France, which led to French words dominating the vocabulary of automobiles. French words such as "chassis," "garage," "carburettor," and "chauffeur" all originated from the French automobile industry. Additionally, other French words like "coupé," "limousine," and "cabriolet" were originally used to describe horse-drawn carriages before being applied to automobiles.

The author then discusses the various terms that were used to describe the motor car before "automobile" became widely used. Some of the suggested names included "Benzene buggy," "diamote," "self-motor," and "autovic." The British magazine The Autocar popularized the term "autocar," which was favored by many at the time. The author also includes an excerpt from The New York Times that expressed hesitation in using the word "automobile" due to its Greek-Latin mash-up that was considered indecent.

The book also explores the history of bicycles and their various names. The term "wheel" was commonly used in America to describe bicycles, even though a bicycle has two wheels. The author explains that the first mainstream bicycle was a high-wheeler, which had a prominent front wheel and a smaller trailing wheel. The author also discusses other names for bicycles, including the Greek-Latin mash-up "velocipede" and the term "bike" used in various languages such as French, Italian, Dutch, and German. 

The author covers the time period from 1868 to 1896, which was a period of significant growth and popularity for bicycles. This era is known by various names such as the Belle Époque in France, the Gilded Age in America, and the Late Victorian period in Britain. The author also discusses the transition from bicycles to automobiles, with the latter eventually surpassing the former in sales after the start of World War I.

Throughout the book, the author addresses different terms and their meanings, such as "pavement" in Britain referring to the road instead of the sidewalk, "freeway" in America instead of "motorway," and the difference between "setts" and "cobbles." The author also explains the use of imperial measurements and varying spellings between British and American English.

The book includes historical photographs and mentions significant figures in the cycling and motoring industries. The author also provides online notes for readers to access additional information and sources cited in the book.
