The chapter explores the close connection between cycling and the early days of motoring. It states that many of the pioneers of motoring were actually cyclists before they became motorists. The first motor cars were often developed by individuals with a background in cycling, such as champions in the sport or owners of bicycle manufacturing companies. Cycling journalists also played a key role in the development of motoring.

The chapter argues that cycling had a significant influence on the introduction and acceptance of automobiles. Bicycles and motor cars were developed around the same time, and many of the early efforts in motor car development were based on cycle technology. The chapter discusses how cycling provided a foundation for the development of motoring, particularly in terms of road locomotion.

The chapter challenges the misconception that motorists of the 1890s were from a higher social class than cyclists. It argues that many pioneering motorists were actually from the same class as cyclists and that there was significant overlap between the two groups. In fact, cycling lobbyists were important members of the nascent motor lobby and played a role in overturning oppressive legislation towards motor cars.

The chapter also highlights the elite status of Victorian cyclists and their contributions to motoring. It states that cycling was initially a pursuit of the upper class and privileged individuals, including royalty, aristocrats, and professionals from the middle class. The chapter suggests that the perception of cyclists as men of lower social status only emerged in the 1930s, when cycling had become a popular form of transportation for the working class.

The chapter provides examples of early motorists who continued to cycle even after becoming involved in the automobile industry. It notes that some famous motoring pioneers, such as Henry Ford and William Morris, were avid cyclists and maintained their interest in cycling throughout their lives. The chapter argues that cycling provided valuable skills and experience for early motorists, including road sense and mechanical expertise.

Furthermore, the chapter emphasizes the interconnectedness between cycling and motoring, both in terms of people and geography. It states that many early advocates of motoring had connections to cycling, with some individuals having socialized together as cyclists. It also notes that the motor manufacturing industry was often concentrated in areas where the cycle manufacturing industry had been prominent.

Overall, the chapter argues for the recognition of cycling's crucial role in the history of motoring. It suggests that historians have downplayed this role and have often focused on the elite status of early motorists without acknowledging the influence of cycling on their development. The chapter presents evidence to refute these misconceptions and highlights the significant contributions of cyclists to the early days of motoring.
