The Roads Improvement Association (RIA) was founded in 1886 by a group of cyclists with the aim of advocating for better road surfaces and the nationalization of neglected highways in Britain. The RIA eventually became the cornerstone of the motor lobby but was initially funded and run by cyclists. Many influential figures in the road improvement movement were former cyclists, including Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton, who became a consultant engineer to the British government's Road Board and the vice-chairman of the Automobile Club. Crompton believed that his interest in road surfaces was a result of his time as a cyclist.

The roads in Britain fell into disrepair after the arrival of railways and the collapse of the stagecoach trade. Prior to this, certain turnpike roads had been well-built and improved, but many roads were still in a poor condition. Cyclists played a crucial role in campaigning for better roads and were among the first travelers in a generation to explore Britain through its neglected trunk-road network. The roads surrounding Coventry, in particular, were well-surfaced and used to test and refine high-wheel bicycles.

The quality of the roads in Britain was also praised by American cyclists. However, road conditions varied greatly from parish to parish, and cycling road books and magazines provided detailed information about road conditions. Cyclists raised money to improve roads and even took legal action against negligent surveyors. They also lobbied for better roads locally and nationally, and the formation of the RIA in 1886 marked a new era of organized campaigning for road improvements.

The RIA distributed pamphlets and technical literature to newspapers, highway surveyors, and members of highway boards in order to promote the scientific methods of road construction and improvement. The association also provided iron gauge rings to measure stones used in macadam roads. The RIA had some early successes in improving roads in various parishes, and its work was supported by prominent and well-connected cyclists, including Lord Thring, Sir Alfred Frederick Bird, and the Duke of Fife.

In the early 1900s, the RIA began to focus on political lobbying. Influential cyclist William Rees Jeffreys advocated for the creation of a Central Highway Authority and state grant for highway purposes. The RIA requested an inquiry into highways administration, and in 1903, the government launched an inquiry into the existing system of highway administration. Rees Jeffreys was the first witness and argued for wider, straighter roads that would free up space for motorists on the main roads while ensuring the preservation of ordinary roads for slower road users. The RIA's lobbying efforts led to the creation of the Road Board in 1909, which became the first central authority for British roads since Roman times.

Overall, cyclists played a significant role in advocating for and improving the roads in Britain. Their campaigns and lobbying efforts led to increased funding for road maintenance and the creation of a central authority for roads. The RIA's work benefited not only cyclists but all road users, and their contributions to road improvement should be recognized and celebrated.
