In this text, the author explores the concept of road ownership and the changing roles and perceptions of different road users throughout history. The content focuses on the UK, but also references other countries such as the US. The author addresses the issue of territoriality and how people tend to believe they have priority over others on the road. This territoriality, rooted in biology, has led to conflicts among road users. The author argues that roads belong to all and need to be shared by all, but there is a history of some road users believing they have exclusive rights or entitlements. This belief in ownership often leads to disagreements among motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians about who has the right to use the roads. The author cites examples of motorists claiming cyclists think they own the roads, while cyclists insist it is motorists who have the entitlement issues. The history of road use is traced back to the 19th century when the concept of roads being for travel only was established. Before this, roads were primarily used by pedestrians and other slower users. The introduction of bicycles and later motor vehicles transformed the road's role and led to conflicts over space and rights. The author highlights the lobbying efforts of automobile clubs in the early 20th century to assert the rights of motorists and establish roads as primarily for motor vehicle use. The legacy of these efforts is still evident today, with roads considered primarily for motor vehicles and other users granted access under certain conditions. The author also explores the historical differences in road culture between Germany and Britain, suggesting that British cities were more accepting of motor traffic early on due to a belief in freedom and a fear of conflicts if everyone's rights
