This chapter discusses the history of road surfaces, specifically focusing on the use of asphalt. The chapter begins by highlighting the importance of well-maintained roads for the health and pleasure of people. The author notes that asphalt is a commonly used road surface today, but its adoption was not inevitable. Many different materials were used to cover roads throughout history, including granite setts, macadam, rubber, and wooden blocks. 

The chapter then explores the significance of road surfaces by discussing how potholes can cause damage to cars and accidents for cyclists and pedestrians. The author notes that well-maintained roads can become so smooth that they may cause drivers to become less attentive, leading to accidents. The chapter also mentions the relatively recent development of smooth road surfaces, which have only been in use for the past 80 years. 

The chapter goes on to discuss the history of road surfaces in the 19th century. It notes that, contrary to popular belief, it was not the introduction of motor cars that rid cities of horse manure, but rather sanitation campaigns prompted by epidemics of cholera and other diseases. The chapter describes how urban corporations became efficient at removing manure from city streets and mentions the use of wooden blocks and Australian hardwoods as road surfaces. 

The chapter then describes the road surface treatments used in Victorian and Edwardian times, including granite setts, wooden blocks, and tarmac. It explains that many of London's roads were surfaced with wooden blocks, while setts were mostly found in the East End of the city. The chapter goes on to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of wooden roads, such as their quietness and absorption of horse urine. 

The chapter also explores the use of asphalt as a road surface, noting its ancient history and the various sources of bitumen. It discusses the development of modern asphalt recipes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the popularity of asphalt among cyclists. The chapter concludes by discussing the invention of tarmac, which was made from tar and stones, and its use in dust-abatement trials in the early 20th century. 

Overall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the history of road surfaces and their importance in modern society.
