In this chapter, the author explores the theme of speed and its impact on travel throughout history. The chapter begins with quotes from Lord Byron and the Bible, illustrating the long-standing fascination with speed. The author then discusses John Ruskin, a philosopher in the 19th century who believed that travel became duller as it became faster. However, Ruskin's view was not widely shared, as most people during his time were fascinated by speed and rapid communication.

The chapter then delves into the history of speed in transportation, starting with the development of steam locomotives in the 19th century. At first, locomotives were only slightly faster than stagecoaches, but engineers gradually improved their speed, eventually reaching 20 to 30 miles per hour. This was considered remarkable at the time and was seen as a way to "annihilate time and space." However, there were skeptics who believed that traveling at such speeds was dangerous and even predicted that humans would not survive speeds higher than 30 miles per hour.

The chapter also explores the history of bicycles and their contribution to the fascination with speed. In the late 19th century, bicycles were the fastest vehicles on the road, surpassing the speed of horses and stagecoaches. Bicycles became a popular form of transportation and even led to the development of racing events. However, there were also concerns about the dangers of speeding cyclists and the accidents they caused.

The introduction of motor cars further increased the speed of travel and posed new challenges. Motorists faced opposition from pedestrians and cyclists who felt threatened by the high speeds of motor cars. There were also concerns about the safety of roads and the need to enforce speed limits. The chapter discusses the debates and conflicts that arose around these issues, with some arguing for the right to travel at any speed while others advocated for stricter regulations to protect public safety.

Overall, the chapter highlights the complex relationship between speed, travel, and public safety throughout history. While speed has always been alluring, it has also raised concerns and posed risks for other road users. The chapter suggests that finding a balance between speed and safety remains a challenge in modern transportation.
