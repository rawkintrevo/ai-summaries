In 1886, a group of cyclists founded the Roads Improvement Association (RIA), an organization that advocated for better road surfaces and the nationalization of neglected highways in the United Kingdom. The RIA played a significant role in the improvement of Britain's road system, which was crucial for the growth of cycling and later motor vehicles. Well-known cyclists, such as Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton, who became a consultant engineer to the British government's Road Board, were instrumental in shaping the development of roads. Cycling bodies like the Cyclists' Touring Club (CTC) and the Bicycle Union also played a significant role in road improvement efforts.

In the 18th century, British roads fell into disrepair due to the rise of railways and the decline of the stagecoach trade. Some turnpike roads were well-built, but the majority of roads were in terrible condition. However, there were still a significant number of well-maintained roads throughout the country, particularly in areas where cycling was popular. American cyclists visiting the UK in the late 19th century praised the quality of British roads compared to those in their own country.

Cycling organizations, including the CTC and the Bicycle Union, actively campaigned for better road conditions. They published road books and magazines that highlighted the state of different roads and provided information to cyclists. These organizations raised funds to pay for road repairs and even resorted to legal action against negligent surveyors. They also sent letters and petitions to local authorities and politicians, advocating for improved road surfaces.

The RIA, founded in 1886, aimed to improve roads throughout the UK. It produced pamphlets and technical literature to promote scientific road construction and maintenance. The association lobbied for administrative and legislative changes to the existing system of highways administration and sought to create a Central Highway Authority and secure a state grant for highway purposes.

The efforts of the cycling organizations and the RIA led to significant improvements in road conditions from 1890 to 1902. Expenditure on rural and urban main roads increased, and the annual cost per mile rose. The campaigning of cyclists may not have been the sole reason for the increased spending on roads, but their agitation likely had some effect.

In 1909, the Road Board, the first central authority for British roads since Roman times, was established. One of its early secretaries was William Rees Jeffreys, a former cyclist and longstanding member of the CTC. Despite his hopes for the Road Board to focus on building new roads, its main function was resurfacing existing ones. The funding for the Road Board came from the Road Fund, a tax on motoring.

As time went on, the focus of the RIA shifted more towards provision for motorists, and cycling became associated with the working class. However, the influence of cyclists on the road improvement movement was not forgotten. Rees Jeffreys, in his autobiography, acknowledged that cyclists were the first to take a national interest in the conditions of the roads.

Overall, the efforts of cyclists and cycling organizations in advocating for better road surfaces played a significant role in improving the road system in the UK. Their campaigning efforts led to increased funding for road repairs and influenced the creation of the Road Board, which marked a new era in road administration.
