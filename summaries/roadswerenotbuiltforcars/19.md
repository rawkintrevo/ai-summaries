In the 1890s, America experienced a booming popularity of bicycles, with many high-society members using them as their primary mode of transportation. This led to the creation of a cycle path network across the country, including a popular route from downtown Brooklyn to Coney Island, an ambitious elevated cycle path in California, and long-distance cycle paths connecting cities and towns. These cycle paths were built by cyclists themselves and were seen as a way to demonstrate the need for better roads. However, there was a divide among cyclists on whether separate cycle paths were beneficial or if the focus should be on improving roads for all users. Some believed that cycle paths would become the only routes available to cyclists, while others saw them as an important step towards achieving better infrastructure. The construction of cycle paths was met with opposition in some areas, with property owners arguing that they were obstructing streets and causing safety concerns. Despite the debate, the cycle path network continued to grow, with cyclists paying for the paths through contributions, fundraising events, and annual fees. However, the rise of the automobile and the lack of sustainable funding led to the decline and eventual disappearance of the cycle path network. The California Cycle Way, an elevated cycle path between Pasadena and Los Angeles, was one of the most ambitious projects of its time but faced challenges from competing modes of transportation and rights-of-way issues. Ultimately, the cycleway was not as successful as initially anticipated and was eventually dismantled. The rise of the automobile in the early 20th century further contributed to the decline of cycling and the abandonment of cycle paths as a mode of transportation. Despite their eventual disappearance, the cycle paths of the late 19th century served as a symbol of cycling advocacy and a demonstration of the need for better infrastructure.
