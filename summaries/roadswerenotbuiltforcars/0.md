The book mentioned in this document is about the history of roads and their connection to both cycling and driving. It explores the close relationship between cyclists and motorists throughout history and the influence that cycling has had on the development of roads and the automotive industry. The book argues that the roads were not originally built for cars but were initially designed with bicycles in mind. Many of the technological advancements in transportation, such as ball bearings and pneumatic tires, can be traced back to cycling. The early automotive companies, including GMC, Chevrolet, Land Rover, and Ford, also had strong ties to cycling. The book aims to debunk the argument of "cars vs. bikes" and show that motorists and cyclists are not two separate tribes but rather share a long history and common interests.

The foreword of the book is written by Edmund King, the President of the Automobile Association and a renowned expert in transportation. King shares his surprise at how closely cyclists and motorists were connected in history and how many automotive companies were influenced by cycling. He believes that this book will help to bridge the divide between motorists and cyclists and promote safer roads in the future.

The contents of the book are listed, consisting of an introduction and 15 chapters that cover various aspects of the history of roads, cycling, and driving. The book also includes an epilogue, acknowledgements, appendices with a timeline of road history and motor marques with bicycling beginnings, a bibliography, and an index.

The author of the book conducted extensive research for its content, which was made possible by the financial contributions of backers in a Kickstarter campaign that ran in 2013. The names of these backers are listed in the back of the book. The author expresses his gratitude to the backers, as well as a number of individuals, an organization, and a company, who went above and beyond pre-ordering the book. He thanks them for their generosity.

Overall, the book aims to shed light on the historical connection between cyclists and motorists and to challenge the common belief that roads were built solely for cars. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the influence of cycling on road development and the automotive industry, showing that motorists and cyclists share a common history and interests.
