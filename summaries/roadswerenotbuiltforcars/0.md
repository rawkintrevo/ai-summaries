The book in question is titled "Roads Were Not Built for Cars" and is authored by Carlton Reid. It is copyrighted in 2015 and all rights are reserved. The book discusses the history and origins of roads, highlighting the close relationship between cyclists and motorists. The author argues that many automotive companies, such as GMC, Chevrolet, Land Rover, and Ford, have been influenced by cycling. Ground-breaking technological developments like ball bearings and the pneumatic tire also have their origins in cycling.

The book is supported by financial contributions from the Chartered Institution of Highways & Transportation and the Rees Jeffreys Road Fund. It includes a catalog record from the British Library and was made possible through a Kickstarter campaign in 2013. The book contains a list of all the backers who supported the campaign.

The content of the book is organized into several sections, including a foreword by Edmund King, the President of the Automobile Association. King reflects on his own knowledge and experience with roads and the connection between cycles and cars throughout history. He notes that the history and origins of the AA are closely linked to cycling, and many automotive companies have ties to cycling as well. The book aims to debunk arguments between car and cycle enthusiasts and promote a safer road environment for all.

The book also includes various appendices with a history of roads timeline, motor marques with bicycling beginnings, and a list of Kickstarter supporters. It ends with an acknowledgments section, bibliography, and index. The front cover of the book features an illustration by Pete English, and the back cover includes a photo of an 1898 Benz Velo in front of Glover Brothers Cycle Makers & Engineers in Coventry. The photo highlights the early connection between bicycle shops and motorists, as they were among the few places where motorists could purchase petrol.

Overall, "Roads Were Not Built for Cars" delves into the history and intertwined relationship between cyclists and motorists. It argues that roads were not solely built for cars and highlights the significant influence that cycling has had on automotive development.
