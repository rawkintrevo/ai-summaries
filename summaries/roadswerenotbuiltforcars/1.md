In this preface, the author discusses the shared history between motorists and cyclists. He argues that early motoring relied heavily on the cyclists of the 1890s and that many of the motorists who benefitted from improved roads were the same people who had originally lobbied for better roads for cyclists. The author also emphasizes the importance of bicycles in the development of early automobiles, stating that early motor cars had more DNA from bicycles than from horse-drawn carriages. The first promoters of motoring were also cyclists, and many early automobile manufacturers were also cyclists. The author argues that without cycles and cyclists, motoring would have evolved differently and possibly not caught on. 

The author also discusses the bias against cyclists and the "us vs them" mentality that exists between motorists and cyclists. He argues that cyclists and pedestrians can coexist better in the same space compared to motorists and pedestrians. The author gives examples of car-free events and open streets events where roads are closed to motorized traffic and people can skate, walk, and bike freely. These events demonstrate that roads do not have to be just for cars. The author also mentions the liberating and uplifting experience that residents of Leeds had when the Tour de France bike race came to the city and the A61 dual-carriageway was closed to motor vehicles, allowing people to walk and bike on the road without fear. 

The author argues that roads should be a shared resource and that motorized users should not dominate. He discusses the issue of motorists forcing cyclists aside and not giving them enough room on the road. The author also mentions instances of violence and verbal abuse against cyclists and other non-motorized road users. He points out that motor cars were not the original purpose of roads and that roads were primarily built for pedestrians. The author argues that the acceptance of motor cars was not inevitable and that the fate of motor cars was determined by society, particularly the powerful parts of it. He emphasizes the need to recognize the historical contribution of cyclists to the development of roads and motoring. 

The author addresses the dangers of being reliant on motor cars and the unsustainable nature of using motor vehicles for short journeys. He points out the fear that pedestrians have of motor cars and how this fear compels people to retreat from the street. The author mentions Sweden's "Vision Zero" principle, which aims to eliminate pedestrian deaths from traffic accidents, and how it has inspired other localities, including New York City, to prioritize safety over traffic efficiency. The author argues that roads should be seen as public spaces and not just for cars. He believes that roads belong to all users, including pedestrians and cyclists, and that they should be shared. 

The author concludes by discussing the need for change and the growing recognition of the social, environmental, health, and economic benefits of the "liveable city." He argues that cities should prioritize quality of life for all and remove the infrastructure that encourages motorists to travel faster and make urban areas less pleasant. Finally, the author calls for the celebration of the shared links between different modes of transportation, particularly between cycling and motoring, and the recognition of the role that Victorian cyclists played in the development of roads and motoring.
