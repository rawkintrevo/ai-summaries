In this preface, the author discusses the history and shared roots of cyclists and motorists. The author argues that early motoring was heavily reliant on cyclists, who were the first to lobby for improved roads. The first motor cars were built with many components sourced from bicycles, and many early motorists were also cycling enthusiasts. The author believes that the idea that roads were built for cars is a misconception and that roads were originally built for pedestrians. Society and influential individuals allowed cars to dominate roads, and this dominance has led to a dangerous and divisive mentality between motorists and cyclists. The author argues that cyclists and pedestrians can coexist more harmoniously than motorists and pedestrians, as demonstrated by car-free events. The author also discusses the dangers and unsustainable aspects of relying on motor vehicles, and the need to reclaim roads as shared spaces for all users. The author believes that roads should be seen as shared resources and that the dominance of motorized users should be challenged. The author concludes by stating that history has been written by the winners, and the winners in highway history have been motorists. The author believes that the role of cyclists in highway history has been downgraded and forgotten, and that it is time to give them credit for their contributions. The author hopes to celebrate the shared links between cyclists and motorists that have been overlooked.
