The epilogue of the book discusses the current state of cycling and its coexistence with motor vehicles. The author recognizes that cycling has survived and even thrived in a society that is heavily dependent on automobiles. However, he also points out that the design of the public realm has been influenced by cars, with roads being built specifically for motor vehicles. This has led to a car-dependent world, with roads retrofitted for those with cars only.

The author looks back at the predictions made by early motoring enthusiasts and realizes that they could not have imagined a society so completely dependent on automobiles. Motoring was originally considered elitist, and the idea of motoring for the masses would have been detestable to the pioneers of the automobile. However, one exception was Susan Jeune, Baroness St. Helier, who saw the potential for mass motoring and warned of its potential negative impact on society.

The author provides a quote from Arthur Roy Du Cros, the grandson of William Harvey Du Cros, popularizer of the pneumatic tire. Du Cros wrote in 1938 about the "evils" of motoring, including the desecration of rural areas, litter, and high mortality rates on the roads. The author also includes a quote from William Clay Ford Jr., the great-grandson of Henry Ford, who expresses concern about the future of mobility in a world with increasing vehicle numbers.

The author acknowledges the help and support he received during the four-year process of researching and writing the book. He thanks his family for their patience and support, as well as librarians and researchers who provided assistance. He also expresses gratitude to beta readers and historians who helped spot errors in the book.

In Appendix A, the author provides a timeline of the history of roads. Starting from ancient times, the timeline highlights significant milestones such as the construction of the Appian Way in ancient Rome, the introduction of steam-powered locomotives, the invention of the bicycle and the motor car, and the formation of motoring organizations.

Overall, the epilogue and appendix provide additional context and historical information related to the themes discussed in the book. The author reflects on the current state of cycling and the coexistence of cyclists and motorists in a car-dependent world, and also provides a timeline to show the evolution of roads and transportation over time.
