In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there was a seamless transfer of technology, personnel, and finance between bicycle and motor car companies. The first automobiles contained more cycle DNA than horse-drawn carriage DNA. Motor car manufacturers benefitted from products, production techniques, materials, innovations, and tooling that were either developed specifically for cycles or perfected for them. Some of the developments adopted by the automobile industry from the cycle industry were differential gearing, ball bearings, chains, shaft-drives, tubular steel frames, aluminum, horns and lamps, and bonnet badges. Engineers and innovators who transferred from cycling to motoring kept on innovating and usually did so with no further contribution from the world of cycling.
The invention of the bicycle had a significant influence on the development of the automobile. In fact, some argue that no preceding technological innovation, not even the internal combustion engine, was as important to the automobile as the bicycle. This is because many of the key innovations, from electric resistance welding to steel-frame tubing and from pneumatic tires to metal-stamping technology, were perfected by cycle companies before being adopted by automobile companies. The cycle industry was at the cutting edge of industrial design in the late 19th century, with frequent launches of new products that improved on earlier models, making them lighter and faster. The industry also popularized the concept of planned obsolescence, which would later be adopted by the automobile industry. The cycle industry developed new promotional techniques and perfected the trade show and annual model changes. Cycling companies were also pioneers in advertising and marketing, creating competitive advertising content, image advertising in posters
