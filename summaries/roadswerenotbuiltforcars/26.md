In this chapter, the author discusses the history of cycling and its relation to social class. The chapter begins by noting that in the late 19th century, cycling was seen as a progressive mode of transportation, but by the 1920s, it had become associated with lower-class individuals. The chapter then explores how the rise of the motorcar led to a decline in cycling, as cars became the preferred mode of transportation. This decline continued throughout the mid-20th century, as roads were designed primarily for cars and cycling was relegated to the margins. However, the chapter also notes that in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in cycling, with more individuals taking up the activity as a form of transportation. The chapter concludes by arguing that the future of cycling will depend on the continued development of infrastructure and the ability of policymakers to create environments that are conducive to cycling.
