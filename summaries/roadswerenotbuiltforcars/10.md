This chapter discusses the concept of speed and its impact on travel throughout history. The author begins by highlighting the fascination with speed during the 19th century, with rapid communication and transportation being seen as pleasurable. However, the freedom to travel fast on public highways has always limited the freedom of others. The author then explores the development of speed in transportation, starting with the early steam locomotives in the 1800s. Locomotives were initially thought to be only slightly faster than stagecoaches but soon exceeded expectations by reaching speeds of 20 to 30 miles per hour. The author notes that although these speeds may seem slow by modern standards, they were considered amazing at the time and transformed travel by "annihilating time and space." The chapter also discusses the rise of cycling as a fast mode of transportation in the late 19th century, with bicycles being faster than stagecoaches and horses. The author mentions that cyclists were the fastest vehicle on the roads during this time and often faced criticism for their speed. However, with the invention of the motor car, cyclists were no longer the fastest vehicles on the road. Motorists quickly embraced speed and often exceeded speed limits, leading to concerns about safety and the need for regulations. The chapter concludes by highlighting the ongoing debate about speed and its impact on travel, with some advocating for slower, more sustainable forms of transportation while others continue to emphasize the thrill and convenience of high-speed travel.
