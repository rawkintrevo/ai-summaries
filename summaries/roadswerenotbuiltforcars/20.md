In the late 1800s, American cyclists held significant political influence and were able to impact local and national elections. The League of American Wheelmen (L.A.W.) played a key role in this, with their members also serving in the federal government. In San Francisco in 1896, a parade of 5,000 cyclists showcased their political power, which was seen as a threat by politicians who did not support their demands for improved roads. The L.A.W. and other cycling organizations used their influence to campaign for better road conditions, particularly in major cities such as Chicago and New York. They advocated for candidates who supported good roads and could sway elections with their block votes. Many prominent individuals, including politicians and media moguls, were keen cyclists and used their positions to further the cause of cycling. In Britain, however, the cycling vote did not hold the same influence, and there was no organized political lobbying by cyclists. Nevertheless, cycling enthusiasts, including politicians and media figures, were still influential in promoting the sport and advocating for road improvements. The suffragette movement in Britain used bicycles as campaign vehicles to spread their message, highlighting the practical uses of cycling in political activism. In America, the L.A.W. had gained significant influence by the creation of the Office of Road Inquiry within the federal government. The L.A.W. provided expertise, lobbying efforts, and funding for the Office, which in turn supported the L.A.W.'s efforts for good roads. This partnership allowed the L.A.W. to advance their cause behind the scenes and gain the support of the government. The Office of Road Inquiry eventually developed into the Federal Highway Administration. However, the role of cyclists in this important moment in American highway history has been largely forgotten, overshadowed by the rise of the automobile industry. Nevertheless, cyclists in the late 1800s held significant political power and were able to impact policy and elections through their advocacy for good roads.
