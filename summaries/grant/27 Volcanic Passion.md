In this chapter, the focus is on the strained relationship between Grant and Edwin Stanton. Stanton's dyspeptic personality and brusque treatment of Grant, as well as their disagreements over power and authority, created tension between them. Despite these conflicts, Grant still respected Stanton's wartime accomplishments and saw him as a patriot with a passion for the Union.

The chapter begins with Johnson's intention to fire Stanton, which led Grant to send a letter to the president expressing his disagreement with the move. Grant believed that Stanton's removal would violate the Tenure of Office Act and argued that Johnson should have requested it while the Senate was in session. Grant believed he was right in his stance and declared his allegiance to the Radical Republican fraternity, which further strained his relationship with the administration.

Johnson couldn't dismiss Stanton without Grant's support, so he looked for a legal means to fire him. He sent Stanton a letter asking for his resignation, which Stanton refused. This set the stage for a constitutional impasse between Congress and Johnson, with Grant caught in the middle.

On August 11, Johnson asked Grant to become the temporary Secretary of War, to which Grant agreed with the condition that he would not hold the position after the Senate acted on Stanton's suspension. However, Johnson interpreted this differently and believed that if the Senate reinstated Stanton, Grant would hand the position back to him.

Grant took the position of Secretary of War because he felt the need to submit to civilian direction as a soldier. He also feared that if he declined the position, Johnson might offer it to someone who shared his conservative agenda on southern policy. Grant believed that by holding the office, he could protect the army from political interference in executing Reconstruction.

During his time as temporary Secretary of War, Grant made it clear that he supported Congressional Reconstruction and would stand by his military commanders in the South. He attended cabinet meetings and voiced his opinions on legal questions, which some secretaries found arrogant. Grant saw himself as embodying the Union cause and preserving Lincoln's legacy.

The chapter also covers the events surrounding Stanton's reinstatement and the impeachment trial of President Johnson. Grant played a significant role in these events, supporting Stanton's reinstatement and later supporting the impeachment of Johnson. Grant's involvement in these political battles solidified his reputation as a potential presidential candidate and led to his nomination by the Republican party.
