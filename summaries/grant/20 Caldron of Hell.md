In Chapter Twenty of "Grant" by Ron Chernow, the author describes the events that took place during the summer of 1864 as General Ulysses S. Grant continued his campaign against the Confederate army. Grant's objective was to destroy the principal Confederate armies under Robert E. Lee in Virginia and Joseph E. Johnston in Georgia. However, he also faced challenges in the form of oppressive heat, dust, flies, and a lack of supplies for his own troops.

Grant extended his line west and south of Petersburg, forcing Lee to follow suit and fortify his own positions. Grant's ultimate goal was to strike at the railroads that fed Richmond, hoping to strangle the Confederate capital into submission. In late June, Grant began attacking the South Side and Danville Railroads, although these attacks resulted in heavy losses for the Union.

Despite the setbacks, Grant remained optimistic about the war's outcome. He noted that Lee's army was starting to include very young and old soldiers, a sign of desperation. Grant believed that the Confederacy was running out of able-bodied men and that victory was only a matter of time.

To replenish his army, Grant appropriated soldiers from Washington's defenses, allowing him to transfer an entire corps northward in case of an emergency. Halleck expressed concerns that Grant's movement south of the James River would leave Washington vulnerable to a raid by Lee. However, a fortunate turn of events occurred when General David Hunter withdrew from the Shenandoah Valley, leaving it open for a Confederate force under Jubal Early to attack Washington or Baltimore. Grant sent troops to defend these cities and prevent Early from inflicting further damage.

On July 8, Early's raiders penetrated western Maryland, causing panic and spreading terror among the local residents. They threatened Washington after defeating a Union force at the Monocacy River. However, Grant's reinforcements arrived in time to prevent any further advances by Early. The situation remained tense, but the Confederate forces eventually retreated back into Virginia.

As Grant and his men continued the siege of Petersburg, Grant faced a number of challenges and setbacks. One of these was the failure of the mine explosion at Petersburg's defenses, known as the Crater. Despite the initial success of the explosion, the subsequent attack by Union troops was poorly executed, resulting in heavy casualties and the failure to capture Petersburg.

Grant's health also began to suffer during this time. He experienced lassitude and jangled nerves, likely due to the stress and disappointment of the Crater failure. He relied heavily on his chief of staff, John Rawlins, but Rawlins's health also deteriorated, and he took a three-month leave of absence to recuperate.

Despite these challenges, Grant remained determined. He appointed Philip Sheridan to command the troops in the Shenandoah Valley and gave him full authority to wage total warfare against the Confederate forces there. Grant believed that by cutting off Confederate supplies and sacking the valley, he could tighten the pressure on Lee and make it more difficult for him to reinforce his positions.

The chapter ends with Grant and his wife, Julia, finding solace in each other's company. Despite the hardships and setbacks of the war, Grant's determination and the support of his family kept him focused on his ultimate objective of victory.
