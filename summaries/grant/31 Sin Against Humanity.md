In this chapter, the author discusses a scheme led by Jay Gould and James Fisk Jr. to corner the market in gold in 1869. Gould and Fisk concocted a plan to drive up the price of gold by buying as much of it as possible, causing a panic and forcing the government to halt gold sales. Gould and Fisk enlisted the help of Abel Corbin, who was married to President Grant's sister, Virginia, to try to persuade Grant to limit gold sales. Although Grant initially seemed interested in the plan, he eventually realized that Gould and Fisk were trying to manipulate him and halted their efforts. The scheme became known as the "Gold Corner" and led to a crash in gold prices and financial turmoil. 

The author also discusses Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, a senator from Massachusetts. Sumner had been a strong advocate for abolition and had clashed with Grant over foreign policy issues, particularly the Alabama claims, which sought compensation from Britain for its support of the Confederacy during the Civil War. Sumner's speech denouncing the Johnson-Clarendon Convention, which sought to settle the claims, led to its defeat in the Senate. Grant was angered by Sumner's opposition and their relationship became strained. 

The chapter also touches on Grant's efforts to secure voting rights for African Americans. The Fifteenth Amendment, which granted voting rights to African American men, was ratified during Grant's presidency. Grant celebrated the amendment and spoke out in favor of black suffrage. However, the amendment also led to a violent backlash from white southerners, who sought to suppress black political power. Grant was frustrated by the resistance to black suffrage and the attempts to disenfranchise black voters. 

The chapter concludes with Grant's attempts to reshape the Supreme Court. He nominated his attorney general, Ebenezer Hoar, and his close ally Edwin Stanton for vacancies on the court. However, both nominations were rejected by the Senate. Grant eventually nominated Joseph P. Bradley and William Strong to fill the vacancies.
