In this chapter, the focus shifts to President Grant's efforts to pass the Santo Domingo Treaty and his battle against the Ku Klux Klan. The chapter opens with a description of Grant's year-end message to Congress in which he touted the success of the nation and proposed a survey of the Isthmus of Darien for a possible canal. Grant also expressed the need for internal unity and addressed the progress being made by former slaves.

The chapter then delves into Grant's challenge from Senator Charles Sumner on the Santo Domingo Treaty. Grant found himself in a precarious position, with a divided cabinet and strong opposition from Sumner. Grant visited Sumner in an attempt to garner his support, but Sumner seemed more interested in discussing the appointment of James M. Ashley. Grant's misunderstanding of the situation and his refusal to appoint Ashley ultimately led to a breakdown in the relationship between Grant and Sumner.

The focus then shifts to Grant's battle against the Ku Klux Klan. Grant recognized the threat the Klan posed to civil rights and took vigorous action to suppress their activities. He enacted the Ku Klux Klan Act, which granted him extraordinary powers to suspend habeas corpus, declare martial law, and send in troops to combat the Klan. Grant's efforts were met with resistance from Democrats and conservative Republicans who saw his actions as an overreach of federal power.

Grant's attorney general, Amos T. Akerman, played a central role in the fight against the Klan. He used his position to prosecute Klan members and dismantle the organization. The chapter describes the success of Akerman's efforts and the impact they had on Southern society. However, Akerman's clashes with the railroad industry and pressure from special interests led to his resignation.

Grant appointed George H. Williams as Akerman's replacement, and the fight against the Klan continued under his leadership. Williams brought even more cases and achieved more convictions than Akerman had. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of Grant's efforts in suppressing the Klan and protecting civil rights.

Overall, this chapter highlights Grant's determination to fight for his policies and protect the rights of citizens. It also showcases the challenges he faced from political opponents and the powerful influence of special interests. Grant's success in combating the Klan demonstrates his commitment to equal rights and the rule of law.
