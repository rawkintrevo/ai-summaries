In Chapter Twenty-One of his book "Grant," author Ron Chernow discusses the events of late 1864 and Grant's role in the Union's war effort. As the summer of 1864 progressed, Grant continued to pound away at the rebels besieged in Petersburg, testing every weakness in their armor. He used his skillful tactics and formed alliances with other Union generals, such as Sherman and Sheridan, to put constant pressure on the Confederacy.

Grant's unwavering determination and tenacity delighted President Lincoln, who praised Grant for his grit and likened him to a "bull-dog" with a tight grip on the situation. Despite setbacks and disillusionment among the Northern populace, Lincoln's reelection prospects were bolstered by Sheridan's victories in the Shenandoah Valley and Sherman's capture of Atlanta. Lincoln's reelection victory in November 1864 further secured Grant's position as the general in chief of the Union army.

Grant's political maturity and commitment to the Union cause became increasingly apparent during this time. He wrote shrewdly crafted letters demonstrating his complete agreement with the Lincoln administration's stance on the war, particularly on the issues of abolition and the preservation of the Union. Grant also advocated for black recruitment and the aid of runaway slaves, further solidifying his commitment to the war effort and setting the agenda for his future career.

The chapter also covers the presidential election of 1864, which posed a major test for American democracy. Grant and his army were eager to cast their votes, and Grant argued for soldiers in the field to be allowed to vote. Ultimately, Lincoln won a resounding victory in the Electoral College, though the popular vote was much closer. Grant celebrated the peaceful election as a victory for democracy and a testament to the strength of the Union.

Throughout the chapter, Chernow highlights Grant's strategic acumen and his ability to coordinate and command multiple theaters of war simultaneously. From his headquarters at City Point, Grant kept a close eye on Sherman's successful march through Georgia and Thomas's victories in Tennessee. He also continued to pressure Lee in Virginia, maintaining the siege at Petersburg. Grant's efforts to keep Lee occupied and prevent him from reinforcing other Confederate forces were crucial to the Union's success.

The chapter also explores Grant's personal life during this time. He briefly visited his family in Burlington, New Jersey, and found some respite from the war. Grant expressed his desire to settle his family in Burlington permanently after the war and focused on their well-being, offering to bring his ailing father-in-law to live with them.

Overall, the events of late 1864 showcased Grant's strategic brilliance, his commitment to the Union cause, and his growing political acumen. Despite setbacks and challenges, he continued to pressure the Confederacy on multiple fronts and oversee the Union's march toward victory.
