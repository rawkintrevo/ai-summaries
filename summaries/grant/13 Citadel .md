This chapter of the book "Grant" by Ron Chernow focuses on the Siege of Vicksburg during the American Civil War. Grant and his soldiers had been surrounding Vicksburg, a Confederate stronghold, for several weeks, and by May 18, they had successfully cut off the last supply route for the Confederate soldiers. Grant and his army were eager to secure supplies for their men and rode ahead with advance skirmishers, exposing themselves to danger. Despite being fired upon, Grant and Sherman inspected Haynes' Bluff, a critical high ground that Sherman had failed to take in December. The seizure of this bluff was a strong response from Sherman and demonstrated the success of Grant's overall strategy.

Grant ordered an assault on May 19 but was surprised when the Confederate soldiers put up a strong resistance. The assault resulted in heavy casualties for the Union forces. Grant scheduled a follow-up attack for May 22 but was concerned about the conditions that his men would face in the Mississippi heat. Nevertheless, he made sure his men were properly outfitted for the assault.

The second assault on May 22 was even bloodier than the first, with thousands of Union soldiers killed, wounded, or missing. Grant's plan was further marred by a misleading report from John A. McClernand, who claimed that two rebel forts had been captured. Grant diverted troops to support McClernand, even though he couldn't see that either fort had been taken. Grant blamed McClernand for the self-serving deception and later regretted his decision to heed McClernand's call for more troops.

After the failed assault, Grant transitioned to a classic siege strategy to choke off supplies for the Confederate soldiers inside Vicksburg. His men dug trenches and entrenchments, and Grant had numerous artillery guns aimed at the city. He also assigned Sherman to fend off any attempts by Joseph Johnston to rescue the trapped Confederate soldiers. Grant's competent leadership and determination impressed both his own men and Confederate generals.

As the siege wore on, Grant focused on relieving the suffering of runaway slaves who were flooding into his camp. He endorsed the enlistment of black soldiers and recognized their courage and discipline in battles. Grant worked with Chaplain John Eaton to provide aid and education to the freed people in contraband camps. Grant also supported the creation of a model community for freed slaves at Davis Bend, where they could demonstrate their industry and self-reliance.

By late June, the Confederate soldiers in Vicksburg were starving, and their morale was low. Grant continued to bombard the city and cut off any attempt at escape. Finally, on July 4, white flags appeared along the Confederate parapets, and two high-ranking emissaries approached Grant with a request to surrender. Grant, who had the upper hand, refused to yield an inch and made it clear in his response that he would accept nothing less than unconditional surrender.

At a meeting between Grant and Pemberton, the Confederate general initially refused to accept the terms of surrender, but eventually capitulated when faced with the alternative of a full-scale attack. Grant presented generous terms that would allow Confederate soldiers to march out with their honor intact. The siege of Vicksburg was over, and Grant had secured one of the most important Union victories of the war.
