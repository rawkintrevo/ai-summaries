This chapter focuses on General Grant's efforts to shut down remaining southern ports that defied the Union blockade. His main objective was capturing the port of Wilmington, North Carolina, which provided essential imports for Lee's army. Grant believed that seizing Wilmington would also help maintain the Union blockade and prevent foreign governments from recognizing Confederate ports. However, his first attempt to take Fort Fisher, the fort guarding the mouth of the Cape Fear River, failed. This was largely due to a failed plan to explode gunpowder near the fort, and Grant ultimately fired General Ben Butler, who had led the expedition.

Despite this setback, Grant prepared for a second operation against Fort Fisher, this time led by General Alfred Terry. On January 6, 1865, the expedition set sail and after heavy naval bombardment, the Union forces captured the fort and took over 2,000 prisoners. This victory marked the end of the main Confederate port on the east coast, significantly weakening the Confederacy.

Meanwhile, Grant continued his efforts to tighten the noose around Richmond and Petersburg. He worked to sever their southern rail links and isolate the towns. He also sent General Sheridan on an expedition to wreck the railroads and the James River Canal that supported Lee's army. By early January, Grant had effectively cut off any supplies or reinforcements reaching Lee.

Sherman's army, on the other hand, had been on a destructive march through Georgia, devastating supply bases and transportation networks that kept Lee's army alive. By early February, he was ready to move north through the Carolinas, carving a path of destruction. Sherman's troops were battle-tested and fueled by a crusading spirit, burning everything of strategic value in their path. Grant anticipated that Lee would flee south to North Carolina or head west toward Lynchburg, Virginia.

Throughout this time, Grant's relationship with President Lincoln grew closer. Grant respected Lincoln's leadership and saw him as a man of great intellect and benevolence. Meanwhile, Lincoln viewed Grant as a great general and trusted his military judgment. Grant often sought Lincoln's advice and the two men would spend hours in conversation. In March 1865, Lincoln visited Grant at City Point, where the general was stationed, and they discussed strategies to end the war and bring about peace.

Overall, Grant's military campaigns were tightening the noose around the Confederacy. The capture of Fort Fisher, the destruction of supply lines, and Sherman's destructive march all weakened Lee's army and brought the Union closer to victory. Grant's close relationship with Lincoln also played a crucial role in the Union's eventual success.
