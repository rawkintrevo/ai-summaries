In Chapter Nineteen of Ron Chernow's biography "Grant," the focus is on Grant's actions during the Overland Campaign and the beginning of the Siege of Petersburg. 

The chapter begins by describing Grant's frustration with General Ben Butler and his Army of the James. Grant believed that Butler could have made significant progress pushing up the James River and seizing territory south of Richmond, but Butler's slow movements and caution allowed Lee to rush reinforcements to Richmond. Grant also laments the missed opportunity to capture Richmond while Lee was distracted in the north. However, historians believe that Butler's failure may have actually prolonged the war.

Despite these setbacks, Grant's grand strategy was still on track by mid-May. Sherman ousted Johnston from Dalton, Georgia en route to Atlanta, Sheridan destroyed major railroads serving Richmond, and Butler captured the outer defenses of Fort Darling below Richmond. However, Beauregard defeated Butler at Drewry's Bluff and forced him back to the James River. Grant had planned to trap Lee between his army and Butler's, but Beauregard effectively neutralized Butler and even sent reinforcements to Lee's army.

Grant decides to have most of Butler's army brought to him, except for enough to keep a foothold at City Point. Grant receives criticism for his harsh language against Butler, but his plan to trap Lee had been upended. 

Grant's next moves include Sherman's campaign in Georgia, Sigel's defeat at the Battle of New Market in the Shenandoah Valley, and Grant's unsuccessful attempt to break through Lee's line at Spotsylvania. The failure at Spotsylvania leads to second-guessing and soul-searching among Grant and his staff.

Grant's soldiers are also growing weary of the constant fighting and casualties. Grant continues to push forward, attacking Lee's troops whenever he can. However, his frontal assaults are met with heavy losses and little gain. Grant eventually decides to change his strategy and begins a siege of Petersburg, hoping to sever the railroad connections to Richmond and force Lee to surrender.

The chapter also touches on Grant's relationship with his wife Julia and his meetings with President Lincoln. Lincoln visits Grant's headquarters and the two men develop a camaraderie and respect for each other. Grant also meets with General Butler, Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee, and tours areas that the Union army has seized.

Overall, Chapter Nineteen paints a picture of Grant's determination and resiliency in the face of setbacks. He continues to push forward and adapt his strategy in order to achieve victory.
