Chapter one of the book explores the early life and childhood of Ulysses S. Grant. Grant was born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, a small rural town near Cincinnati. The Grant family lived in a humble house near the Ohio River, and Ulysses grew up in a modest and rural environment. His father, Jesse Root Grant, worked as a foreman at a tannery, while his mother, Hannah Simpson Grant, was a pious and reserved woman.

The chapter delves into the Grant family's ancestral history, tracing back to early Puritan settlers in Massachusetts. It also mentions the military service of Grant's ancestors, including his great-grandfather, who fought in the French and Indian War, and his father, who was said to have fought in the Revolutionary War (although this claim is disputed).

The chapter describes Jesse Grant as a brash and ambitious man who was involved in local politics and was often engaged in verbal combat. He had high hopes for his son and tried to push him to excel. However, Ulysses was a quiet and reserved boy who preferred simple, innocent pastimes like swimming and playing with horses. He did not share his father's ambitions for politics or business.

Despite his father's attempts to mold him, Ulysses developed a strong sense of modesty and humility, traits that were influenced by his mother's reserved and gentle nature. The chapter also mentions Ulysses's love for horses and his skill in handling them. He was known for his ability to tame wild horses, and he took pride in treating the animals with kindness and respect.

At the age of 14, Ulysses was sent to Maysville Seminary, a private academy in Kentucky, where he continued his education. However, due to financial difficulties, he had to return home after a year. His father then arranged for him to attend the Presbyterian Academy in Ripley, Ohio, where he received a solid education and developed an interest in current affairs.

While Ulysses was content with a quiet life on his family's farm, his father saw potential in him and applied for his admission to West Point Military Academy. Despite his initial reluctance, Ulysses agreed to go along with his father's plan, and in a stroke of luck, a vacancy opened up at West Point just in time for his application.

The chapter concludes with Ulysses's apprehension about attending West Point, as he was uncertain if he had the necessary qualifications to pass the exams. However, his father's determination and influence led him to accept the appointment and embark on a new chapter in his life.
