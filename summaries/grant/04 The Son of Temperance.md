In Chapter Four of the book "Grant" by Ron Chernow, the author provides a detailed account of Ulysses S. Grant's life after the Mexican War. Grant's responsibilities as quartermaster, his engagement to Julia Dent, their wedding, and their subsequent time apart are all covered in detail.

The chapter starts by recounting a mishap that occurred before Grant's departure from Mexico. Grant was responsible for regimental funds, which were stolen from his locked trunk. Grant faced a board of inquiry but was eventually exonerated of any wrongdoing. However, he still had to replace the lost thousand dollars, which caused him anxiety.

Grant and his regiment sailed from Veracruz to East Pascagoula, Mississippi. Grant received a leave of absence and made a beeline for St. Louis to see Julia. He had matured and appeared more worldly and cosmopolitan. Grant had put on weight and looked tan and ready for the battles of life. The couple finally got married on August 22, 1848, in a simple ceremony.

After the wedding, Grant and Julia traveled to Bethel, Ohio, to visit his parents. Grant was embraced as a war hero wherever he went, and he talked extensively about his experiences in the Mexican War. During his time in Bethel, Jesse and Hannah Grant made it clear that they disapproved of the slave-owning Dent family, and they boycotted the wedding.

The Dents reciprocated the disapproval, and Julia's cousin Louisa Boggs felt that Grant was not a good match for Julia. Despite these tensions, Grant and Julia's love for each other remained steadfast, and they were eager to start their life together.

Grant returned to his duties as quartermaster and sailed to Detroit, where he faced a rude awakening. His replacement refused to cede the Detroit position, and Grant was reassigned to Sackets Harbor, New York. Grant continued to impress his comrades with his initiative and resourcefulness, fixing leaky roofs and refurbishing houses.

Grant's time in Detroit and Sackets Harbor was marked by his dedication to the temperance movement. He took the pledge not to drink alcohol and became involved in the Sons of Temperance. Grant wore the lodge's sash and ribbon proudly, and his involvement was approved by Julia.

However, Grant's struggles with alcohol resurfaced during his time in Sackets Harbor. The combination of loneliness, ennui, and frustration led him to sporadically indulge in binge drinking. He recognized his problem and sought counsel from his pastor, but he still struggled with periodic lapses in sobriety.

Grant's separation from Julia continued to weigh on him. He missed the family, and it took months for their letters to reach him. He also faced financial difficulties, which led him to consider leaving the army and starting a business to support his family.

Grant's time in Sackets Harbor also involved a disastrous journey to California. The Fourth Infantry joined a crowded ship bound for Panama, where cholera broke out. Grant showed remarkable courage and leadership, tending to sick soldiers and civilians. However, the journey was marred by tragedy, and many people died from cholera.

When Grant finally reached California, he faced further hardships and disappointments. His speculative business ventures failed, and he struggled to make a living. He also battled depression and anxiety and longed to be reunited with Julia and their children.

In conclusion, Chapter Four provides a thorough account of Grant's post-Mexican War life, including his work as quartermaster, his marriage to Julia Dent, his struggle with alcohol, and his difficulties in making a living in California. The chapter presents a nuanced and detailed picture of Grant's personal and professional life during this period.
