In April 1860, Ulysses S. Grant arrived in Galena, Illinois with his wife Julia and their four children, looking for a fresh start. Galena was a prosperous town, but Grant had been a failure in every endeavor he had pursued so far in life. He took a job at his father's leather goods store in Galena, where he served customers, bought and sold hides, and handled paperwork. Despite his confidence being damaged, Grant retained an underlying self-esteem and worked diligently in the store. He displayed small business aptitude, but some saw him as haphazard or apathetic. 

Grant professed contentment with his job, denying feeling degraded, and expressed pride in his Galena accomplishments. With advances from the firm and gifts from Colonel Dent, Grant slowly regained solvency. However, his salary barely supported his family, and he had to practice extreme frugality. Grant's brother Simpson, who had managed the store, was forced to retire due to consumption, so Orvil, Grant's younger brother, took over. Orvil was described as a corrupt and irresponsible man, disliked by the people of Galena. Grant tolerated working under Orvil, but it was clear that they had very different personalities and values.

As the political climate in the United States grew tense leading up to the 1860 presidential election, Grant supported the Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln. He attended political meetings and engaged in discussions about the future of the country. When Lincoln won the election, Grant believed that the South would not go as far as secession, but he was proven wrong when states started to secede. He grew increasingly militant in his thoughts, and his transformation into a Unionist was solidified.

With the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, Grant decided to join the Union army. He mustered a group of volunteers in Galena, but initially struggled to secure a commanding position due to his lack of political connections and his reputation as a "deadbeat military man" by some. However, Grant persisted and was eventually given a position on the adjutant general's staff in Springfield, Illinois. He participated in the mustering of new recruits and showed his military expertise and professionalism. 

Grant's dedication and skills were recognized by Governor Richard Yates, who assigned him to oversee the mustering of additional regiments in Illinois. Grant's talents demanded greater leeway, and he was given the authority to raise ten new regiments. He traveled to different cities in Illinois, mustering in new recruits. 

During this time, Grant's thoughts on slavery and the war started to evolve. While he initially focused on preserving the Union, he began to see the role slavery played in the conflict and the potential for emancipation. As the war progressed, Grant's views on slavery would continue to change and shape his actions as a military leader.
