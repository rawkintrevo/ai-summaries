In this chapter, the author discusses Ulysses S. Grant's experiences during the Mexican War. Grant joined his regiment in 1844, near the Texas border, as part of the Army of Observation. Grant opposed the annexation of Texas and was critical of the war itself, which he believed was unjust. He served in various roles during the war, including as a quartermaster, and showed bravery and leadership in battle.

Grant's regiment camped near the Texas border as part of the Army of Observation. From there, Grant sent frequent letters to his wife, Julia, describing his experiences and thoughts. He also expressed frustrations with his superiors, particularly Colonel Dent, father of Julia, who was against Grant's service in the war. Grant tried to secure Dent's permission to marry Julia, but Dent objected to Grant's army life.

The author describes the political climate surrounding the Mexican War, with debates over Texas annexation and the extension of slavery. President Polk, a Democrat, was in favor of the war, while many Whigs, including Grant and his family, opposed it. The Whig victory in the 1846 elections shifted the balance of power in Congress, leading Polk to change his military strategy and appoint Winfield Scott to lead the campaign.

Grant distinguished himself in battle, showing bravery and leadership. He participated in the battles of Palo Alto, Monterrey, and Cerro Gordo, among others. He also worked as a quartermaster, handling logistics and supply for the army. Grant had mixed feelings about the war, recognizing the brutality and suffering it caused, but also experiencing a sense of triumph and fulfillment in his own achievements.

After the fall of Mexico City, peace negotiations took place, resulting in the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The treaty expanded American territory, but also intensified the conflict over the extension of slavery. Grant believed that the Mexican War was a punishment for the United States' transgressions and that the Civil War was an outgrowth of the war.

Overall, the chapter provides a detailed account of Grant's experiences during the Mexican War and offers insights into his views on the conflict and its consequences. It highlights Grant's military skills and abilities, as well as his moral and political convictions.
