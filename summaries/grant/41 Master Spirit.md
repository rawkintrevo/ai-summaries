In Chapter Forty-One, the author describes Ulysses S. Grant's concerns about the resurgent southern Democrats and the rise of the "solid South." Grant believed that unless the North rallied by 1880, the government would be in the hands of those who had tried to destroy it during the Civil War. Grant also worried about labor unrest and the railroad strikes that had plagued the Hayes administration. He had a desire to introduce consular reforms, international arbitration, and new trade agreements. Grant's popularity at home was rejuvenated as he traveled, and he began to consider entering the 1880 election. His old comrades Sheridan and Sherman also expressed their support for Grant's potential run. Sherman wrote to Grant explaining how southern leaders threatened the progress of Reconstruction, but that threat had now receded, and Sherman felt it would be unnatural for him to oppose his brother if he were a candidate for president. 

During his travels, Grant was often met with enthusiastic crowds, and there was talk of a possible third term. He was careful to conceal any lust for power, but the author notes that Grant had a way of standing back and letting things happen, which was seen as a tacit form of approval. Grant also leaned towards a third term, evident from his appearances across the country and the fact that John Russell Young rushed to publish a book about Grant's world tour in time for Christmas 1879. Grant also encouraged the quick publication of his military history book by Badeau. Grant's son, Buck, offered a subtler view of his father's ambivalence about running for a third term, suggesting that Grant felt a sense of duty to accept if he could fill the role.

The author describes Grant's sudden transformation into a beloved figure during his southern tour and his ability to captivate audiences with speeches that showed his support for civil rights and the rights of African Americans. Grant's newfound popularity in the South made it seem possible for him to peel away several states from the Democratic grip. However, there were still many southerners who resented Grant for Reconstruction and blamed him for the region's woes.

The chapter also explores Grant's relationship with his brother, Orvil, who had a history of being a trouble to the family due to his drinking and financial problems. Orvil had been committed to an insane asylum, but was later released and turned up in Philadelphia in a drunken, ragged state. Grant tried to support his brother, but his presence became a headache during the Republican convention.

The chapter concludes with the Republican convention in Chicago, where Grant's hopes for a third term were dashed. Garfield emerged as the nominee, and Grant threw his support behind him, campaigning vigorously in support of his candidacy. The chapter ends with Grant's belief that he had made a significant contribution to Garfield's election and his relief that the country had escaped a great calamity by not falling into the hands of the Democrats.
