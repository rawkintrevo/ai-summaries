In this chapter, Grant becomes somewhat conflicted about the congressional bill that would promote him to lieutenant general and make him chief of the northern war effort. He feared that this promotion would take him away from the battlefield and chain him to a desk, weakening his contribution to the war effort. Additionally, Grant didn't want to bypass his superior, General Halleck, and leapfrog over him in the military hierarchy. However, Grant did recognize the financial benefits of promotion, as his salary would increase significantly. Despite his reservations, Grant didn't actively work against the bill and eventually accepted the promotion.

Grant's promotion to lieutenant general garnered a lot of attention and support from various politicians and military men. Elihu Washburne, a congressman and friend of Grant's, was particularly vocal in his support, citing Grant's humility, lack of pretension, and devotion to the Union. Washburne's fervent support of Grant did raise some eyebrows, with some questioning his self-interest in promoting a man with whom he was so closely aligned. Nevertheless, the bill passed through Congress, with Grant's name being removed in the Senate version, and Grant was officially appointed lieutenant general by President Lincoln.

Upon his arrival in Washington, Grant was met with crowds of people and a reception at the White House. He was hailed as a hero and idolized by the public. However, Grant himself felt uncomfortable with all the attention and longed to return to the field. He quickly established his headquarters in the field at Culpeper Court House and began formulating his military strategy.

Grant made several key changes in the upper echelons of the war effort, demoting Halleck to army chief of staff and appointing Sherman as head of the Military Division of the Mississippi. He also retained Meade as commander of the Army of the Potomac, despite some initial doubts. Grant believed that maintaining Meade in command would help boost the morale of the troops and avoid any accusations of favoritism. Grant and Meade developed a good working relationship, with Grant respecting Meade's bravery and loyalty despite his temperamental outbursts.

Grant also had a close working relationship with President Lincoln. The two had a shared vision of how to approach the war, with Grant implementing a strategy that focused on destroying enemy armies rather than capturing territory. Lincoln had studied military strategies and closely followed the progress of the war, and he recognized the qualities of a true military leader in Grant. With Grant at the helm, Lincoln felt a weight lifted from his shoulders and trusted that the Union army was in capable hands.

Overall, Grant's promotion to lieutenant general solidified his position as the leading commander of the Union forces and brought new hope to the North. With Grant's strategic mind and unwavering determination, the Union was on the brink of a major turning point in the war.
