In this chapter of the book, it is discussed how President Grant dealt with the 1876 presidential contest and the threat it posed to the gains made by the Republican Party and black voters during Reconstruction. Grant remained committed to ensuring the safety of black voters and spoke out against the systemic violence and terrorism being used to suppress their rights in the South. However, Reconstruction was already faltering in the face of Supreme Court rulings that weakened the powers of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.

One of the key events discussed in this chapter is the massacre in Hamburg, South Carolina, where armed white mobs attacked and killed black citizens who were exercising their right to vote. Grant received pleas from the governor and others to send federal troops to protect black voters, but he hesitated to do so without clear evidence of the state government's inability to handle the situation. Ultimately, troops were dispatched to South Carolina and other contested states to ensure a peaceful election.

The chapter also highlights the disputed presidential election of 1876, in which Republican Rutherford B. Hayes defeated Democrat Samuel Tilden. Grant, who had no personal or political loyalty to either candidate, focused on maintaining peace and order during the transition of power. He supported the creation of an Electoral Commission to settle the disputes over the election results in the contested states, and ultimately recognized Hayes as the winner.

The chapter concludes with an assessment of Grant's presidency and his legacy. Grant was criticized for the corruption scandals that occurred during his administration, but he was also praised for his efforts to protect the rights of black Americans and his work in foreign affairs. The chapter argues that Grant's presidency was a period of missed opportunities for Reconstruction, but also acknowledges the challenges he faced in trying to achieve equal justice and his enduring commitment to the civil rights of freed slaves.
