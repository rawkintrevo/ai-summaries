When Ulysses and Julia Grant arrived in Washington on April 13, 1865, they were greeted by a capital filled with patriotic decorations and celebrations. Grant's purpose in coming to Washington was to dismantle the army and reduce national expenses. He advised Stanton to cease recruiting activities and the purchase of new weaponry. Grant and Mary Lincoln were to attend a grand lighting of the capital in honor of Lee's surrender and the fall of Mobile, but Julia Grant was excluded. On the ride, Grant was received with cheers and enthusiasm from the crowds, while Mary Lincoln felt envious of the attention he was receiving.

That night, the Grants attended a party at the Stanton household, where they encountered a mysterious man inquiring about General Grant. This man, later identified as Michael O'Laughlen, was a former Confederate soldier and friend of John Wilkes Booth. O'Laughlen was charged with stalking Stanton and Grant with the intent to kill, but it was suggested that he may have been trying to warn Stanton about Booth's plot. The Grants left Washington the next day, but Grant received news that Lincoln had been shot while on their train. They stopped in Philadelphia, where they learned of Lincoln's death, and Grant expressed his grief and shock.

Grant returned to Washington and witnessed the chaos and mourning in the city. He was given the responsibility of organizing the funeral and overseeing the security of the capital. Grant also had to deal with the aftermath of Sherman's peace agreement with Johnston, which had caused controversy and outrage in Washington. Grant personally traveled to meet with Sherman and ended up having him renegotiate the terms of surrender. The feud between Sherman and Stanton escalated, but Grant tried to mediate between the two.

The Civil War came to a symbolic end with the Grand Review of the Union armies, which lasted two days. Grant and Sherman both participated in the grand parade, and Sherman's troops received a warm welcome from the crowds. Grant's western army, which had carried him to military glory, was especially meaningful to him. The parade marked a high point in Grant's career, and he was hailed as a hero by the crowds.

Overall, this chapter shows Grant's role in the aftermath of the Civil War, including his efforts to bring peace and stability to the nation. It also highlights the tension and conflicts that arose during this time, particularly between Grant and Stanton and between Sherman and Stanton. Despite these challenges, Grant remained focused on his duty and worked to maintain order and unity in the country.
