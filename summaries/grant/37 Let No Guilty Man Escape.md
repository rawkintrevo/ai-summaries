In Chapter Thirty-Seven, the focus shifts to a scandal that threatened President Grant directly. The scandal involved the Whiskey Ring, a group of whiskey distillers who evaded taxes on their products through fraudulent means. Grant was not directly involved in the scandal, but it surrounded him and threatened to tarnish his administration. The scandal came to light in 1874, when Treasury Secretary Benjamin Bristow began investigating fraudulent activity in St. Louis, one of the major brewing centers of the country. Grant had appointed his friend General John McDonald as the supervisor for internal revenue for Arkansas and Missouri, not knowing that McDonald was part of the whiskey cabal. Grant's close connection with McDonald led to rumors that Grant himself was involved in the scandal, but there was no evidence to support this claim.

In June 1874, Bristow, with Grant's approval, began raiding distilleries and tax offices in St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, uncovering evidence of widespread tax evasion. However, as the investigation progressed, it became apparent that Grant's personal aide, Orville Babcock, was involved in the scandal. Babcock had been secretly communicating with McDonald, warning him of impending investigations. Despite Babcock's involvement, Grant remained loyal to him, refusing to force his resignation. This led to tensions between Grant and his Treasury Secretary, Benjamin Bristow, who believed that Babcock was guilty. Eventually, Babcock was indicted, but he was acquitted in trial, which Grant interpreted as a vindication of Babcock's innocence.

The scandal had a significant impact on Grant's presidency. It tarnished his reputation and undercut his efforts at civil service reform. Grant had hoped to root out corruption in the government, but the Whiskey Ring scandal undermined these efforts. Furthermore, the scandal reinforced the perception that Grant was not a strong leader and that he was easily influenced by corrupt individuals. Despite these setbacks, Grant remained popular among the American public, who saw him as an honest and principled leader.

In addition to the Whiskey Ring scandal, the chapter explores Grant's stance on public education. Grant believed that education was essential to maintaining a democratic society, and he advocated for free and universal education. He believed that education should be separate from religious influence, and he expressed his views on this matter in a speech and in his annual message to Congress. Grant's advocacy for public education was well-received by many, but it also drew criticism from those who believed that religion should have a place in education.

The chapter also touches on the continuing violence and intimidation against Republicans, particularly African Americans, in the Deep South. Democrats and white supremacist groups targeted black voters who attempted to exercise their voting rights. President Grant initially hesitated to intervene, but eventually sent federal troops to Mississippi to ensure fair elections. However, the elections were marred by violence and intimidation, and Democrats emerged victorious.

Overall, Chapter Thirty-Seven provides a detailed look at the Whiskey Ring scandal and its impact on Grant's presidency, as well as Grant's advocacy for public education and his response to the continued violence against Republicans in the South.
