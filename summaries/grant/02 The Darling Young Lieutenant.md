In Chapter Two of the book, we are introduced to a young Ulysses S. Grant as he prepares to leave his family and hometown to attend West Point. Grant, who was small for his age and lacked maternal affection, expresses a sense of wanderlust and excitement as he travels to Philadelphia and New York before arriving at West Point. Despite his initial reluctance to attend the military academy, Grant quickly adapts to the strict lifestyle and excels academically, particularly in mathematics.

Grant forms friendships with his fellow cadets, including future generals such as William Tecumseh Sherman and George H. Thomas. He is admired by his peers for his honesty, integrity, and ability to mediate disputes. Grant also develops a talent for horseback riding and excels in equestrian classes at West Point. He graduates in the top quarter of his class and receives an assignment in the Fourth Infantry Regiment at Jefferson Barracks in Missouri.

During his time at Jefferson Barracks, Grant becomes acquainted with the Dent family, particularly Julia Dent, whom he falls in love with. Despite her father's initial opposition to their relationship, Grant and Julia become engaged in secret before Grant is sent to Louisiana with his infantry unit. They exchange class rings and Grant promises to marry her. 

In this chapter, we also learn about Grant's family background, including his father, Jesse Grant, and his rebellious nature and entrepreneurial endeavors. Jesse wishes for Ulysses to take over the family tannery business, but Ulysses has other aspirations. 

Overall, this chapter explores Grant's early life, his entrance into West Point, his success at the academy, and his blossoming relationship with Julia Dent. It sets the stage for the challenges and triumphs that lie ahead for Grant as he embarks on his military career and eventually becomes the commanding general of the Union Army during the American Civil War.
