In this chapter, Grant's victory at Vicksburg is described in detail. The Confederate soldiers marched out of the city in defeat and Union soldiers greeted them with respect and compassion. Grant's accomplishments in the Vicksburg Campaign were praised, and he was commended for his ability to reduce the enemy's strength through capture rather than slaughter.

After the surrender of Vicksburg, Grant toured the devastated city and saw the toll the siege had taken on its residents. He was struck by the contrast between the well-fed Union soldiers and the emaciated Confederate soldiers. Grant's compassion for his defeated foes was evident as he witnessed Union soldiers sharing their rations with hungry Confederates.

Grant's triumph at Vicksburg solidified his position as a leading general in the Union army. President Lincoln recognized Grant's abilities and praised him for his service to the country. Grant and Lincoln developed a close relationship and communicated directly with each other, further strengthening their bond.

Following the fall of Vicksburg, Grant turned his attention to other campaigns and planned to attack Mobile. However, his plans were delayed due to logistical constraints and other priorities such as foreign policy concerns.

Grant's period of inactivity allowed him to witness the public adulation he received for his victories. He was hailed as a hero, and people flocked to see him wherever he went. However, Grant remained humble and downplayed his own achievements.

Grant's visit to New Orleans was marred by an accident in which he was thrown from his horse. There were rumors that Grant was intoxicated at the time, but the exact details of the incident remain unclear. Despite the accident, Grant continued his duties and worked closely with Stanton to address the unfolding crisis in Chattanooga.

The battle of Chickamauga resulted in a Union defeat, and Grant was tasked with rescuing the besieged army in Chattanooga. He traveled to Nashville and met with Andrew Johnson before continuing on to Chattanooga. The journey was difficult and treacherous, but Grant persevered and arrived in Chattanooga to take command of the situation.

In conclusion, Grant's victory at Vicksburg solidified his position as a leading general and earned him praise from President Lincoln. Despite facing setbacks and challenges, Grant remained determined and focused on his goal of preserving the Union. His compassion for his defeated enemies and his ability to adapt and overcome made him a respected and successful military leader.
