In Chapter Twelve of the book "Grant" by Ron Chernow, the focus is on General Ulysses S. Grant's campaign to capture Vicksburg during the American Civil War. The chapter begins with the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln, which expanded the war objectives to include the abolition of slavery. Grant's thinking had evolved in tandem with Lincoln's, and he now opposed slavery on practical, military, and religious grounds.

Grant hoped to subvert the southern economy, bridge a widening rift in his own party, and capture the allegiance of mass opinion in Europe through his campaign. The chapter describes how Grant, along with Admiral David D. Porter, planned a daring nighttime operation to run gunboats past the batteries at Vicksburg and establish a beachhead for Grant's troops south of the city. This plan proved successful, and Grant's army was able to cross the Mississippi River and begin their march on Vicksburg.

The chapter details Grant's strategic thinking during the campaign, as he sought to isolate Vicksburg from reinforcements and supplies. He engaged in a series of deceptive maneuvers to confuse the Confederate forces, and his army won a number of battles along the way. One of the key victories was at Champion's Hill, where Grant's forces emerged victorious in a bloody and hard-fought battle.

Grant's ultimate goal was to capture Vicksburg and cut off Confederate supplies and reinforcements, which he believed would force the city to surrender. The chapter describes how Grant's army laid siege to Vicksburg, subjecting the city to constant bombardment and cutting off its supply lines. The Confederate forces held out for over a month, but eventually, on July 4, 1863, they surrendered to Grant.

The chapter concludes with Grant's victory at Vicksburg, which was a major turning point in the Civil War. Grant's success at Vicksburg solidified his reputation as a military genius and earned him the respect and admiration of President Lincoln. Grant's capture of Vicksburg was also a significant blow to the Confederacy, as it cut the South in two and gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.

Overall, Chapter Twelve of "Grant" highlights Grant's strategic thinking and military prowess during the campaign to capture Vicksburg. It shows how Grant's efforts to subdue the Confederacy included not only military victories but also the abolition of slavery and the reshaping of the nation.
