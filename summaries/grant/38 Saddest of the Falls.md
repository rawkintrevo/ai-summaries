In Chapter Thirty-Eight of Ron Chernow's book "Grant," the focus is on the scandals that plagued President Ulysses S. Grant's second presidency. One of the major scandals involved Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, who was accused of being involved in an "Indian Ring" that exploited Native Americans. Grant resisted calls to fire Delano, believing that him resigning would be an admission of guilt. Meanwhile, Delano's son was accused of blackmail and corruption in the Wyoming Territory. Charges against Delano mounted and Grant's failure to remove him upset many, including Benjamin Bristow, who felt that Grant should have been more proactive in addressing the corruption in his cabinet.

Another scandal revolved around Grant's brother, Orvil Grant, who was accused of taking kickbacks from an Indian trading post. Grant's acceptance of his brother's actions caused embarrassment, but it was later revealed that Orvil was slipping into madness, making his behavior more understandable. Grant was criticized for not selecting responsible traders for Indian posts, a duty that fell under his responsibility as president. 

Secretary of War William W. Belknap was the third cabinet secretary enveloped in scandal. Belknap had entertained lavishly with his second wife, using his position to help businessman Caleb P. Marsh obtain a trading post in Indian Territory. Belknap continued to receive payments from Marsh even after his wife died, and he remarried her sister. Belknap's corruption came to light in early March 1876, when it was discovered that he had taken hefty payments for the trading post. Belknap rushed to the White House to tender his resignation before the congressional committee released its critical report on him. Grant accepted his resignation but later realized the implications of his hasty action.

Grant's poor handling of the scandals led many to question his judgment and tarnished his reputation. However, it is important to note that Grant himself was not personally involved in any of the scandals. The scandals largely occurred during the second half of his second term and overshadowed his earlier successes as president. Nonetheless, Grant's blunders in dealing with the scandals revealed his lack of political sophistication and his vulnerability to manipulation.

In addition to the scandals, this chapter also discusses Grant's last cabinet shuffle in spring 1876 and the Republican nomination for the next presidential election. Grant had favored Hamilton Fish as his successor but also held an infatuation for Roscoe Conkling, who was considered disloyal by many reformers within the Republican Party. Ultimately, Rutherford B. Hayes was nominated as the Republican candidate, with William A. Wheeler as his running mate. Grant supported the ticket, but there were tensions between him and Hayes due to disagreements over civil service reform.

The chapter also touches on Grant's involvement in the Centennial celebration, the conflict with the Sioux in the Black Hills and the disastrous Battle of Little Bighorn where General George Custer and his men were annihilated. The aftermath of the battle led to a public outcry for revenge against the Native Americans.

Overall, Chapter Thirty-Eight of "Grant" dives into the scandals that plagued his second presidency, the political climate leading up to the next election, and the challenges of dealing with conflicts with Native American tribes.
