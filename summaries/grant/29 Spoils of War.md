In this chapter, the author explores Grant's early days in office as the President of the United States. From the start, Grant faces challenges and missteps in his cabinet appointments, mainly due to his lack of experience and failure to seek counsel before making decisions. One example is the appointment of Alexander T. Stewart to the Treasury Department, which Grant later realizes is not allowed under an old statute. He eventually withdraws the nomination and appoints George Boutwell instead.

Despite these setbacks, Grant's cabinet is filled with capable individuals, including Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, who becomes a trusted advisor and helps Grant navigate the world of foreign affairs. Grant also takes steps to reform the spoils system by appointing individuals based on their qualifications rather than political connections.

Grant's presidency is marked by significant changes in the government and the country as a whole. The federal government's power expands, and Grant works to modernize and beautify Washington, D.C. He also makes efforts to integrate African Americans, Jews, and Native Americans into government positions, a significant move during this time.

Grant's presidency is not without criticism, however. He is accused of nepotism for appointing family members and friends to government positions. Grant's close relationship with his father-in-law, Colonel Dent, also raises eyebrows. Despite these allegations, Grant remains committed to his family, whom he supports and helps find jobs.

Grant also faces challenges in managing the growing demands of the presidency. He is overwhelmed by the constant influx of job seekers and struggles to balance the power of Congress with his own authority. Grant's commitment to justice and fairness is evident in his support for an eight-hour workday for government laborers and his efforts to combat anti-Semitism and discrimination.

While Grant's presidency is not without its flaws, he remains dedicated to his family and his country. His commitment to equality and justice, as well as his efforts to reform government and improve Washington, leave a lasting legacy. Despite the criticism and challenges he faces, Grant's time in office is marked by progress and change.
