In Chapter Forty-Two of "Grant," the biography by Ron Chernow, the focus is on the aftermath of Ulysses S. Grant's presidency. After the election of James Garfield, Grant picked up hearsay that he might receive a cabinet post or foreign mission from Garfield. However, Grant insisted that he wanted no reward other than the approval of the patriotic people of the land. Garfield expressed disappointment at Grant's reluctance to serve, but Grant did provide advice on policy matters and appointments to Garfield. However, the relationship between Grant and Garfield deteriorated when Garfield appointed James Blaine as secretary of state, a man Grant considered his political foe. Grant took umbrage at this and believed he had been double-crossed by Garfield. Grant publically chastised Garfield, violating an unspoken rule that presidents do not chastise their successors. The relationship deteriorated further with a series of appointments by Garfield that infuriated Grant, particularly the appointment of Judge William H. Robertson as collector of the port of New York, a position Grant believed he had earned. By May, Grant described himself as completely disgusted with Garfield's deeds and allowed their feud to play out in the press.
 
On July 2, Garfield was shot in a Washington train station by a mentally disturbed office seeker, Charles Guiteau. Grant, who had previously kept an icy distance from Garfield's wife, Lucretia, went to her immediately after hearing about the shooting and expressed his deep sympathy. Garfield's physician seriously mismanaged his treatment, and Garfield died on September 19. Grant received the news while staying in a New York hotel and was overcome with grief, weeping bitterly. The death of Garfield lifted Chester Arthur into the presidency, and Grant found his influence reinstated at the White House. He was instrumental in the appointment of Frederick T. Frelinghuysen as secretary of state. However, Arthur's commitment to civil service reform and his appointment of William E. Chandler as secretary of the navy, a man who had opposed Grant's third term, led to tensions between Grant and Arthur. Grant had difficulty relinquishing his old hold on Washington and accepting his diminished authority. Despite his financial difficulties, Grant was able to secure a $250,000 Presidential Retiring Fund to supplement his income. He returned to his scheme for a Mexican railway system and sketched out his blueprint at a fancy dinner organized by his friend Mat√≠as Romero, the Mexican minister. Grant also accepted a loan from Charles Wood, the manager of a brush factory, to help with his financial troubles. 
 
The chapter concludes with the failure of Grant & Ward, the investment firm in which Grant had placed his trust. Grant and his three sons had invested their life savings in the firm, believing they were earning huge profits. However, it turned out that the firm was a complete fraud, orchestrated by Ferdinand Ward, who had used Grant's name to attract investors. Grant was left penniless and had to rely on the kindness of strangers for basic necessities. Despite the humiliation, there was an outpouring of sympathy for Grant, who was seen as a victim of the fraud. The collapse of Grant & Ward had wide-ranging repercussions, leading to the failure of several banks and brokerage houses. Ward was arrested and tried to shift the blame onto his victims, but he was eventually found guilty of fraud.
 
Overall, this chapter explores the difficult period after Grant's presidency, where he faced disappointment, strained relationships, and financial ruin. Despite these setbacks, Grant remained resilient and continued to seek opportunities to rebuild his life.
