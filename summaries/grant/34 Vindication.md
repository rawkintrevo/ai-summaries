This chapter provides an in-depth examination of Ulysses S. Grant's presidency and the corruption scandals that occurred during his time in office. Despite Grant being an honest and upright man, he surrounded himself with individuals who were involved in corrupt activities. Grant's trusting nature and loyalty to his friends often blinded him to their true motives. However, Grant's efforts to combat corruption and promote civil service reform were thwarted by a political system that thrived on patronage and favoritism.

Grant's presidency took place during the Gilded Age, a time of widespread corruption and political scandal in America. Grant's administration was marred by various scandals, including the Credit Mobilier scandal and the New York Custom House scandal. These scandals arose from the rapid expansion of the government and unregulated growth of industry, as well as the influence of political machines and the Republican Party's long rule.

Grant attempted to address the issue of patronage and corruption through civil service reform. He established the nation's first Civil Service Commission, which aimed to promote meritocracy and end the practice of appointing individuals based on political connections. However, Congress did not fully support Grant's reform efforts, and civil service reform was ultimately unsuccessful during his presidency.

Grant's second term was marked by the rise of the Liberal Republican Party, a group of Republicans dissatisfied with Grant's presidency and the corruption within the Republican Party. The party nominated Horace Greeley as their presidential candidate, but he was ultimately defeated by Grant in the election. Despite divisions within the Republican Party, Grant won re-election with a large majority of the popular vote.

Grant's policies on Reconstruction and civil rights were also significant during his presidency. He worked to protect the rights of newly freed slaves and advocated for equal rights for women. Grant's commitment to civil rights drew support from black leaders and abolitionists, who viewed him as a champion of their cause. However, Grant faced opposition from Democrats and some Republicans who were growing weary of Reconstruction efforts.

Overall, Grant's presidency was a complicated and challenging time in American history. Despite his best efforts to combat corruption and promote civil service reform, Grant was unable to fully overcome the pervasive corruption of the Gilded Age. However, his commitment to civil rights and his efforts to protect the rights of newly freed slaves were significant achievements of his presidency. Grant's re-election in 1872 affirmed the widespread support he had among the American people, despite the challenges he faced during his first term.
