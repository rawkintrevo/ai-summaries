In this chapter, the author describes Grant's time in White Haven, where he had hot-tempered political discussions with his father-in-law, who was pro-Confederacy. Grant also saw firsthand the divided sentiments in St. Louis, where he witnessed the Unionists' fear that the southern-leaning governor would seize the city's federal arsenal. Grant later reflected on the importance of St. Louis being saved from Confederate hands.

Grant struggled to find a permanent job and was frustrated by the lack of recognition he received. He reported that he was willing to command a regiment if the President saw fit to entrust one to him. He eventually received a telegram from the governor appointing him colonel of the 7th Congressional District Regiment, which was later renamed the Twenty-First Illinois. Grant commanded this regiment and worked to instill discipline and order among the troops.

Grant's regiment went through various battles, but they were mostly minor skirmishes. Grant continued to prove himself as a disciplined and competent leader. He also showed his commitment to sobriety, as he imposed strict rules against alcohol consumption among his men.

Grant's leadership caught the attention of higher-ranking officers, and he was eventually promoted to brigadier general. He took command of the military district of Ironton and then the District of Southeast Missouri. Grant faced many challenges in these positions, including shortages of supplies and the need to train inexperienced troops. He also dealt with conflicting personalities, such as General Fremont, who declared martial law in Missouri without consulting President Lincoln.

Grant made his headquarters in Cairo, Illinois, where he worked tirelessly to organize and train troops. He faced many administrative challenges but was assisted by John Rawlins, who became his chief of staff. Rawlins was a close friend and confidant to Grant, and he played a crucial role in keeping Grant sober and focused on his military duties.

Despite the difficulties Grant faced, he remained determined and focused on his mission. He wrote to his wife Julia, expressing his hopes for further success and his belief that he would make a difference in the war effort. Grant's dedication and leadership would eventually lead him to even higher command positions and eventually to become the commanding general of the Union Army.
