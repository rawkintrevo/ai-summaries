In Chapter Thirty-Five of "Grant," author Ron Chernow delves into the political and personal challenges faced by Ulysses S. Grant during his second term as president. One major obstacle was Louisiana, which had become a hotbed of corruption and violence. Grant struggled to find capable, honest individuals to fill government positions in the state, as the political climate was fraught with fraud and illegality. Despite his efforts to remain impartial, Grant was forced to intervene when the situation became dire. He sent federal troops to restore order in Louisiana, particularly in the aftermath of the Colfax Massacre, where dozens of black citizens were brutally killed by white supremacists.

Grant's handling of the Louisiana situation received both praise and criticism. Some admired his decisive actions, while others, especially Liberal Republicans, were tired of the ongoing problems in the South and wanted the federal government to disengage. Grant faced opposition from within his own administration when it came to court appointments, particularly the nomination of George Williams for the Supreme Court. Williams faced criticism for his lack of legal experience and ethical questions surrounding his personal finances. Grant persisted in his nomination, but ultimately had to withdraw Williams' name due to overwhelming opposition.

Personal tragedy also struck Grant during this time. His father, Jesse Root Grant, passed away in June 1873. Grant was devastated by his father's death and struggled with unresolved feelings towards him. Additionally, Colonel Frederick Dent, Grant's father-in-law, passed away a few months later. Julia Grant, always close to her father, was deeply affected by his loss.

Grant remained a devoted father throughout his presidency, closely following the lives and education of his four children. His eldest son, Fred, struggled at West Point and did not excel academically. His second son, Buck, attended Harvard and embarked on a legal career. Jesse, the youngest, gained acceptance to Cornell despite his limited education. As for his daughter, Nellie, she garnered attention from the press and eventually married Algernon Sartoris, an Englishman. The marriage proved to be an unhappy one, with Algernon's drinking and womanizing causing strain. Grant and Julia were disappointed by the turn of events and regretted the loss of their daughter to England.

Chapter Thirty-Five highlights Grant's commitment to justice and his efforts to restore order in a turbulent time. The challenges he faced in Louisiana and the personal losses he endured paint a picture of a man who, despite flaws, was dedicated to upholding the principles he believed in.
