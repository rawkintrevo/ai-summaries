In chapter eighteen of the book "Grant" by Ron Chernow, we learn about General Ulysses S. Grant's campaign against Confederate General Robert E. Lee in the spring of 1864. Grant celebrated his forty-second birthday in late April and scheduled the launch of his campaign for May 4. His army would cross the Rapidan River while Benjamin Butler and his Army of the James would push up the river as far as possible, gunning for Richmond. Sherman would attack Joseph Johnston in Georgia and Sigel would invade the Shenandoah Valley. Grant was impatient to begin the fighting and longed for a battle.

On April 30, Lincoln sent Grant a letter expressing his satisfaction with Grant's plans and granting him total freedom. Grant replied that Lincoln and Stanton had responded to all his wishes and that he would not blame them if he did not achieve the success he desired. Grant's confidence and gratitude towards Lincoln were evident in the letter, and he made sure to reaffirm that he would not blame Lincoln or Stanton for any failures.

On May 4, Grant and his army crossed the Rapidan River and began their march into hostile territory. Grant planned to move to the left, which would allow him to cooperate better with Butler's army and provide safeguards for Washington. He believed that once his troops reached a certain point, Richmond would be his. Grant and Meade reviewed the strategy for simultaneous strikes against the enemy in multiple locations, and Grant issued orders that set his massive army in motion under the cover of darkness.

The Battle of the Wilderness began on May 5, and both Grant and Lee fought relentlessly for two days. The fighting was brutal and intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Grant refused to concede victory to Lee and instead focused on the overall war effort, believing that his army had achieved success in crossing the Rapidan River and uniting as a cohesive unit. The Battle of the Wilderness was the opening act in a long campaign, and although it was inconclusive, Grant believed it was a step in the right direction.

Following the Battle of the Wilderness, Grant continued to push forward against Lee, even as the weather took a turn for the worse. He remained determined and focused on defeating Lee's army and ultimately capturing Richmond. He led his men in multiple attacks, capturing prisoners and artillery, but also suffering heavy casualties. Grant's determination and perseverance were admired by his troops and praised by President Lincoln.

The fighting in Spotsylvania Court House was just as brutal and intense as the Battle of the Wilderness. Grant selected General Winfield Scott Hancock to lead the attack and the Union forces made repeated attempts to break through and capture Confederate fortifications. The fighting resulted in a stalemate and heavy casualties on both sides. Grant considered it a victory, but acknowledged that the Confederate defenses were formidable and the fighting had taken a toll on his own army.

Grant's determination and resolve were evident throughout the campaign. Despite the heavy losses and setbacks, he remained focused on his objective and refused to back down. His determination and relentless pursuit of victory earned him the respect and admiration of his troops and the confidence of President Lincoln. Grant's campaign against Lee during the spring of 1864 was a turning point in the Civil War and set the stage for the ultimate Union victory.
