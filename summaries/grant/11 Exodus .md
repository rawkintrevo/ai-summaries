In Chapter Eleven of “Grant” by Ron Chernow, the focus shifts to Ulysses S. Grant’s experiences in northern Mississippi during the Civil War. The chapter highlights Grant’s defensive operations in Corinth, his dealings with guerrilla bands, and the challenges he faced from spies and support for the rebellion among local inhabitants. Despite these obstacles, Grant remained committed to his mission, defending long railway lines, telegraph wires, and wide rivers located deep in enemy territory. The chapter also touches on Grant’s evolving views on the Confederacy and slavery, as he comes to recognize the need for a more aggressive prosecution of the war and the liberation of slaves.

Grant’s experiences during this period reveal his resilience and determination as a military leader. Despite facing difficulties in his command and the loss of troops to Don Carlos Buell, Grant remains focused on his objectives. He recognizes the importance of defending the areas under his jurisdiction and takes steps to do so, despite feeling thinly manned and surrounded by the enemy. His efforts to protect local residents from mistreatment by his soldiers illustrate his commitment to justice and his sense of duty.

The chapter also explores Grant’s evolving views on slavery and emancipation. As the Union army pushes deeper into the Mississippi Valley, Grant is faced with the reality of fugitive slaves seeking asylum in his camps. This forces him to reconsider his views on the institution of slavery and its role in the war. Grant’s thinking undergoes a transformation as he realizes the importance of emancipating slaves and enlisting their support in the Union cause. He recognizes that the war is not just about preserving the Union, but also about bringing an end to slavery and liberating millions of African Americans.

Grant’s acceptance of emancipation and his willingness to support the Union army. “If necessary, take up all active sympathizers and either hold them as prisoners or put them beyond our lines. Handle that class without gloves and take their property for public use.”
In his actions and orders, Grant shows compassion and empathy for the former slaves who seek refuge in his camps. He recognizes their vulnerability and the need to provide them with protection, food, and shelter. Grant also takes steps to ensure that they are treated fairly and with dignity, even as he faces challenges and opposition from within his own ranks.

The chapter concludes with Grant’s growing recognition of the importance of Vicksburg, and his plans to lead a major offensive against the Confederate stronghold. Grant’s strategic thinking and his recognition of the need to cut off Confederate supply lines and control the Mississippi River highlight his military acumen and his determination to win the war. Despite setbacks and challenges, Grant remains focused on his objectives and committed to the liberation of the South.

Overall, Chapter Eleven of “Grant” provides a detailed account of Ulysses S. Grant’s experiences in northern Mississippi during the Civil War. It highlights his resilience, his evolving views on slavery, and his strategic thinking as a military leader. The chapter sheds light on Grant’s character and his commitment to justice, freedom, and the preservation of the Union.
