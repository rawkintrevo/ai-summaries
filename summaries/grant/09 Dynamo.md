Chapter nine of the book focuses on General Ulysses S. Grant's efforts to capture Fort Donelson during the Civil War. The chapter details the strategic importance of Fort Donelson and the challenges Grant faced in trying to capture it. Despite the fort's strong defenses and the difficult terrain surrounding it, Grant remained determined to take it and achieve victory for the Union.

The chapter begins by describing the physical characteristics of Fort Donelson, highlighting its elevated position, extensive earthworks, and heavy guns that were strategically placed to defend against enemy attacks. Grant realized that taking the fort would not be as easy as capturing Fort Henry, but he believed that with careful planning and the support of gunboats, he could succeed.

Grant made sure to familiarize himself with the terrain and potential approaches to the fort, personally scouting the area and identifying safe routes for his troops. He also wrote a letter to his sister, expressing his confidence in his ability to successfully lead his army and achieve victory against the Confederate enemy.

With the arrival of gunboats and reinforcements, Grant launched his attack on Fort Donelson. The weather was unusually warm, and the troops marched with good spirits, singing songs along the way. Grant's plan was to pin down the Confederates with infantry while the gunboats attacked from the river.

The battle started on February 14, with the Union gunboats engaging in a fierce fight against the Confederate defenses. While the gunboats sustained heavy damage, Grant remained resolute and determined to continue the fight. Eventually, more gunboats and troops arrived, strengthening Grant's forces.

Despite heavy casualties on both sides, Grant's troops began to gain the upper hand, and the Confederates inside the fort started to surrender. General Simon Bolivar Buckner, who had once helped Grant financially, eventually surrendered the fort to Grant. The capture of Fort Donelson was a major victory for the Union and established Grant as a hero.

However, while Grant celebrated his victory, he faced challenges from his superiors. General Henry Halleck, who had previously praised Grant for his actions, suddenly turned against him. Halleck accused Grant of neglecting his duties and even insinuated that he was drinking too much. These accusations caused Grant great distress and temporarily put his military career in jeopardy.

Fortunately, Grant had the support of friends and allies, including General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman defended Grant and praised his military abilities, helping to convince President Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to intervene in Grant's favor. Grant was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing and allowed to continue his command.

Overall, the chapter provides a detailed account of Grant's determination and strategic prowess in capturing Fort Donelson. It also showcases the challenges he faced from his superiors and the loyalty he received from his subordinates. Despite the setbacks, Grant's victory at Fort Donelson was a turning point in the war and set the stage for further Union successes.
