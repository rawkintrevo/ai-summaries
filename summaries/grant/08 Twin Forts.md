In chapter eight of the book, "Grant" by Ron Chernow, the focus is on the pivotal role that Kentucky played during the Civil War and General Grant's campaign to capture Forts Henry and Donelson.

At the outbreak of the war, Abraham Lincoln recognized the importance of Kentucky as a buffer state between the North and the South. He believed that losing Kentucky would be a significant blow to the Union, as it could potentially lead to the loss of other border states like Maryland and Missouri. However, Kentucky was a state of wavering loyalty, with secessionists and Unionists both vying for control.

The Confederacy made a blunder by invading Kentucky first, with General Leonidas Polk leading the charge. Despite being told to withdraw by his superiors, Polk correctly guessed that Grant planned to advance on the area, so he held his ground. Grant saw an opportunity to strike and decided to capture the strategically important Fort Henry, located on the Tennessee River. By taking this fort, Grant would not only sever Confederate supply lines but also isolate the high fortifications at Fort Donelson.

Grant embarked on the operation with determination and audacity. He sent two well-equipped regiments and an artillery battery up the Ohio River, escorted by two gunboats. They arrived in Paducah, Kentucky, to find the town awash with Confederate flags. However, Grant beat the Confederates to the punch and captured the town without a shot being fired. He issued a proclamation to reassure the civilians that he was there to protect and enforce their rights.

With Paducah secured, Grant set his sights on Fort Henry. He faced delays and setbacks, but his confidence never wavered. Eventually, he launched an attack on the fort, with the gunboats providing crucial support. The Union forces overwhelmed the undermanned and poorly defended fort, forcing the Confederate commander, General Tilghman, to surrender.

The capture of Fort Henry was a significant victory for Grant and the Union. It opened up the Tennessee River and paved the way for further campaigns in the Confederate heartland. Grant's success was recognized by President Lincoln and other important figures in the Union government.

After the capture of Fort Henry, Grant turned his attention to Fort Donelson, located on the Cumberland River. He gathered his officers for a council of war, where they unanimously agreed to move against the fort. Grant wanted to maintain the momentum of his campaign and keep the pressure on the Confederates. However, General Halleck, his superior, was not as enthusiastic and secretly plotted to replace Grant with another general.

Despite Halleck's reservations, Grant pressed forward and prepared to take Fort Donelson. He exhibited self-confidence and a determination to be in control of the situation. Grant's style as a commander was maturing, and he had developed a self-reliance and strategic thinking that would serve him well throughout the war.

In the next chapter, the focus will shift to the Battle of Shiloh, where Grant faced his first major defeat but also demonstrated his resilience and ability to learn from his mistakes.
