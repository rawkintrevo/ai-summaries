In this chapter, the author provides a detailed account of Grant's arrival in Chattanooga and his interactions with General George Thomas. Grant is described as being worn out and bedraggled when he arrives at headquarters, but despite his rough appearance, he is still the commanding presence in the room. Thomas, who is loyal to Rosecrans, is initially cold towards Grant, but eventually warms up to him after Grant's aide, James H. Wilson, speaks up on Grant's behalf. Grant's rough-hewn style and demeanor make an impression on Captain Horace Porter, who becomes one of his key aides. Porter notes Grant's physical traits, such as his beard and stooped posture, but is even more impressed by his intelligence and rapid grasp of complex logistical issues. 

Grant and Thomas scout the terrain around Chattanooga, and Grant realizes that the Union troops are in a dire situation, surrounded by Confederate forces on Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain. Grant immediately sets about restoring health and morale to the troops by opening up a new supply line, known as the "cracker line," which brings much-needed food and supplies to the starving soldiers. Meanwhile, Grant plans a coordinated assault on Missionary Ridge, with Sherman and Hooker attacking the flanks and Thomas attacking the center. The plan is successful, with Union forces storming up the ridge and driving the Confederates into retreat. Grant is praised for his strategic thinking and leadership during the battle.

After the victory at Chattanooga, Grant's reputation skyrockets, and there is talk of him being a potential presidential candidate. However, Grant disavows any political ambitions and declares that his only goal is to see the rebellion suppressed. He is appointed lieutenant general, a rank that had previously only been held by George Washington and Winfield Scott, and given command of all Union armies. Grant spends the winter reorganizing his forces and planning future campaigns. He also incorporates black soldiers into his army and travels to St. Louis to visit his sick son.

Throughout this chapter, the author emphasizes Grant's leadership abilities and his ability to think strategically. He also portrays Grant as a modest and unassuming figure who does not seek personal glory or power. Although Grant's drinking is briefly mentioned, the author notes that he is able to control his consumption and maintain his responsibilities as a commanding general. The chapter ends with Rawlins, Grant's chief of staff, expressing concerns about his own health and possible tuberculosis, but also his continued vigilance in watching over Grant.
