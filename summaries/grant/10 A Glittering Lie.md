In this chapter, we see Grant resuming his command after the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson. The next logical step for the Union army is to capture Corinth in northern Mississippi, which is a major railroad hub that connects the Mississippi River with the Atlantic Ocean. Grant is confident in his abilities and believes he can go anywhere with the success he's had so far. He marches his men to Pittsburg Landing, near Corinth, in preparation for the upcoming battle.

Grant is joined by General Charles F. Smith, his old West Point commandant, who provides him with support and denounces the mistreatment Grant received after the victory at Fort Donelson. Unfortunately, Smith's health is in decline and he eventually dies from an infected leg.

Grant decides not to dig entrenchments for his men at Pittsburg Landing, instead believing that they need discipline and drill more than experience with the pick, shovel, and axe. However, this decision proves to be costly as the Confederate army launches a surprise attack on the first day of the battle.

The battle of Shiloh is described in great detail, with Grant displaying his courage and determination to his soldiers. Despite being caught off guard, Grant leads his men in a strong defense against the Confederates. The battle ends with heavy casualties on both sides, but Grant considers it a Union victory because it prevents the Confederates from retaking their defensive line in Tennessee and Kentucky.

After the battle, Grant faces harsh criticism from the press and is accused of being drunk during the battle. He defends himself and receives support from Elihu Washburne, who stands up for him in Congress.

Grant's command is restored by General Halleck, and he is given control of the District of West Tennessee. He moves his headquarters to Memphis, where he faces challenges in administering the city and dealing with Confederate guerrillas.

Meanwhile, in Washington, there is a change in leadership as George McClellan is replaced by Halleck as the general-in-chief. Halleck proves to be an ineffectual leader, struggling with procrastination and a lack of decisive action.

As the Union army suffers a defeat at the second battle of Manassas, Lincoln restores McClellan to command the combined armies in Virginia. Halleck's career also declines, and he is seen as a "first-rate clerk" by Lincoln.

Overall, this chapter illustrates the challenges and setbacks Grant faced as a commander, but also highlights his resilience and determination to succeed. Despite criticism and obstacles, Grant perseveres and continues to prove himself as a capable leader.
