Chapter Thirty of the book discusses President Grant's mission to settle unfinished business from the war by preserving the Union and safeguarding the freed slaves. One of the main issues he faced was the enormous debt that the federal government had accumulated during the war. Grant and the Secretary of the Treasury Boutwell were united in wanting to retire that debt and redeem paper money. Grant's first major piece of legislation committed the government to paying off bondholders in "gold or its equivalent" and redeeming paper money "at the earliest practicable period." Grant wanted to establish his credibility as a conservative, hard-money man and uphold the honor of the Union cause. 

Grant was also committed to the Radical side of the Republican agenda, which involved conferring equal rights on black people. Grant asked Congress to authorize elections in Virginia and Mississippi to ratify new state constitutions that would secure the civil and political rights of all persons within their borders, regardless of race. Virginia successfully elected a northern-born Republican governor, while Mississippi faced more difficulties due to its black majority. Nevertheless, Grant appointed the first black officeholders in Mississippi history and combated segregation in the U.S. Army. 

Grant also committed federal resources to ensuring black welfare. He intervened to save the Bureau of Education, which had been created to educate freed people but was consistently underfunded by Congress. Grant drafted John Eaton, a chaplain who had done exceptional work resettling freed slaves during the war, to lead the Bureau. Grant also extended an olive branch to Confederate generals, meeting with Robert E. Lee at the White House to discuss a railroad venture. However, Lee remained aloof and did not engage in friendly banter with Grant. 

Grant's administration also made efforts to improve relations with Native Americans. Grant appointed General Ely Parker, a Seneca sachem, as commissioner of Indian affairs, making him the first Native American to hold the job and the first nonwhite person to ascend to such a lofty government post. Grant and Parker embarked on a "Peace Policy" with the Indians, seeking to root out corruption and protect Native American rights. However, Grant's policy was limited in its success as many tribes did not want to renounce their traditional ways of life to settle on reservations. Furthermore, the butchery of buffalo herds by white men led to the destruction of the Indian way of life.  

In addition to these domestic issues, Grant also became obsessed with annexing Santo Domingo, the Spanish-speaking half of Hispaniola (modern-day Dominican Republic). Early in his administration, a speculator named Colonel Joseph Fabens peddled the Caribbean country to the United States, touting its rich resources and potential value. Grant was intrigued by the strategic advantages of Saman√° Bay and sent Colonel Orville Babcock to gather information. However, Babcock ended up negotiating a full-dress agreement for annexation without proper authorization, causing a scandal in Grant's cabinet. Grant continued to push for annexation, but faced opposition from Senator Charles Sumner and Spain's refusal to accept his terms. 

Grant's presidency was marked by efforts to settle unfinished business from the war, protect the rights of freed slaves and Native Americans, and pursue controversial annexation schemes. While Grant achieved some successes, he was also faced with numerous challenges and opposition along the way.
