In Chapter Thirty-Three of Ron Chernow's biography "Grant," the focus is on President Grant's efforts to negotiate a treaty with Santo Domingo and the settlement of the Alabama claims with Great Britain.

The chapter begins by highlighting Grant's determination and perseverance in pursuing the Santo Domingo treaty, despite facing opposition and criticism from figures such as Charles Sumner. Grant believed that annexing Santo Domingo would have advantages for the United States and saw it as a priority. However, Sumner vehemently opposed the treaty and launched personal attacks against Grant, accusing him of trampling senatorial rights.

The chapter also discusses the other initiatives Grant put forth in his annual message to Congress, including measures to rejuvenate America's merchant marine and the creation of two new bureaus in the Interior Department. However, the focus of the chapter remains on the Santo Domingo treaty and the heated debate surrounding it.

Grant requested a joint resolution from Congress to appoint a commission to investigate annexation of Santo Domingo. This resolution required a simple majority vote, rather than the higher two-thirds requirement for passing a treaty. Sumner refused to introduce the resolution, so Grant turned to another member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator Oliver Morton, who presented the resolution on December 12. Sumner and Grant clashed in closed-door committee sessions, with Sumner delivering a vitriolic speech against the treaty known as the Naboth's Vineyard speech.

The chapter highlights the division and animosity between Grant and Sumner, as well as their supporters and opponents in Congress. Grant's supporters praised his message and the resolution, except for the Santo Domingo issue. The resolution passed after a rowdy debate, and the commission was appointed, with Frederick Douglass joining as a member.

Meanwhile, Grant's secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, worked to negotiate a settlement of the Alabama claims with Great Britain. Fish proposed a grand solution, involving negotiations on all outstanding disputes between the two nations. Grant supported this approach and dropped his insistence on Canadian independence. The chapter details the negotiations between Fish and the British ambassador, which led to the creation of the British-American Joint High Commission.

The chapter also covers the removal of Sumner as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which improved the prospects for treaty ratification. Grant and Fish successfully reached a settlement on the Alabama claims, with the British admitting negligence and agreeing to binding arbitration for damages claimed by the United States.

The chapter concludes with the resignation of Fish, who had planned to leave earlier but was convinced to stay by Grant. Grant expressed his relief at Fish's decision to remain, as he valued Fish's expertise and did not believe he could easily replace him. Fish played a major role in shaping the Treaty of Washington and helped secure its ratification.

Overall, the chapter highlights Grant's determination and political skills in pursuing his priorities, despite facing opposition from Sumner and others. It also emphasizes the importance of Fish's role as secretary of state in achieving major diplomatic successes for the Grant administration.
