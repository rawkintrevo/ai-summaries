In Chapter Seven of the book "Our Shared Future: Ending Homelessness in America", authors Jeffrey Olivet and Amanda Andere highlight the challenges of managing and responding to homelessness at subnational levels. They emphasize that by the time regions grapple with the problem, the decisions to be made are often difficult due to factors such as underfunded agencies, lack of coordination across multiple agencies, and a lack of consensus on the issue of homelessness as a governmental responsibility.

The authors argue that the structural barriers outlined in the book have hindered progress in ending homelessness. Despite the efforts of talented professionals, there are still half a million people without housing on any given night in the country. The authors offer a prescription for addressing the issue by focusing on higher-order concerns such as public perception, funding, and placing the problem in a broader societal context.

They discuss three tensions that arise in designing the most appropriate policy response to homelessness: short-term versus long-term solutions, public versus private efforts, and the division of responsibilities between federal and local governments. In terms of short-term versus long-term solutions, the authors advocate for policy and budgeting decisions that prioritize the development of permanent housing solutions rather than temporary measures. They argue that an emphasis on permanent housing is necessary to prevent future homelessness and reduce reliance on emergency shelters.

Regarding public versus private efforts, the authors recognize the limitations of the private market in providing affordable housing for low-income households. They argue that relying solely on the private market is not well-suited to addressing the affordable housing crisis and that there is a need for a strong public action, including public and nonprofit ownership of a portion of the housing stock.

In terms of the division of responsibilities between federal and local governments, the authors argue that both levels have important roles to play in addressing homelessness. They emphasize the importance of federal funding and support, as well as the ability of local governments to leverage resources and implement regulatory tools to promote housing for all.

The authors also highlight the need to change public perceptions of homelessness and housing. They discuss the dehumanization of people experiencing homelessness and the negative stereotypes that contribute to a lack of understanding and empathy. They argue that a successful response to homelessness requires a shift in perception to view it as a structural problem and to see people experiencing homelessness as fully human.

In addition, the authors emphasize the need for sufficient resources to address the crisis. They discuss the current level of federal spending on homelessness and argue that greater funding is needed to provide housing and support services. They also suggest that state and local governments can leverage additional resources through tax reforms and the use of innovative financing strategies.

Overall, the authors present a comprehensive approach to addressing homelessness that includes changing public perceptions, increasing funding and resources, and applying a systems approach to understanding and managing the issue. They highlight the need for both short-term and long-term solutions, public and private efforts, and collaboration between federal and local governments.
