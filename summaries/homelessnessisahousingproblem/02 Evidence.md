Between 2009 and 2019, the number of homeless veterans in the United States decreased by nearly half, a decline of about 36,000 people. While this progress is good news, it raises the question of how the country was able to successfully house veterans and their families while homelessness among the general population, particularly in large cities, continued to worsen. This chapter explores the current landscape of homelessness in the United States, how homelessness has changed over time, the various factors that contribute to homelessness, the consequences of homelessness on individuals and communities, and strategies to prevent and end homelessness.

The current landscape of homelessness in the US is characterized by a shortage of affordable homes. According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, for every 100 households with extremely low incomes, there are only 36 affordable and available homes. This shortage of housing units poses a threat to the health and viability of these households. The problem is particularly pronounced on the West Coast, where states like Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona have fewer than 30 affordable units for every 100 households in need.

To understand the phenomenon of homelessness, it is important to consider both individual attributes and structural factors. Individual attributes, such as poverty, mental illness, addiction, and domestic violence, can increase the risk of experiencing homelessness. Structural factors, such as high housing costs, low rental market vacancy rates, and inadequate affordable housing supply, also play a significant role in driving homelessness. These factors interact with each other, and the risk of homelessness is often higher for individuals with multiple vulnerabilities.

Homelessness has severe consequences for individuals, particularly in terms of health and well-being. People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of premature death, infectious diseases, hospitalization, and victimization. Homeless youth are especially vulnerable, experiencing developmental delays, higher levels of anxiety, and academic underachievement. The consequences of homelessness extend beyond individuals, impacting communities both financially and emotionally. The costs of homelessness include increased spending on emergency health and public safety services, as well as lost revenue from tourism. Moreover, the presence of homelessness can create discomfort and negative emotions among housed individuals.

The most effective solution to homelessness is housing. Many studies have shown that providing housing assistance to individuals and families experiencing homelessness significantly reduces the likelihood of returning to homelessness. Long-term rental subsidies have been particularly effective for families, while permanent supportive housing models that combine housing with support services have been successful for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. Housing is seen as a human right and a key strategy for ending or preventing homelessness.

Research on the effectiveness of interventions to end or prevent homelessness at a regional level is mixed. Some studies have found a negative relationship between federal investments in homelessness and homelessness rates, suggesting that increased funding for housing programs can reduce homelessness. However, other studies have shown that increased funding can also increase the demand for homelessness services, leading to more people entering the homelessness response system. Investments in affordable housing have been found to reduce homelessness at a county level, highlighting the importance of addressing housing affordability as a structural solution to homelessness.

In conclusion, understanding the current landscape of homelessness, its causes and consequences, and effective interventions is crucial in the effort to prevent and end homelessness. Providing housing, addressing structural factors such as housing affordability, and investing in supportive services are key strategies in this endeavor. By adopting a comprehensive approach and focusing on both individual and structural factors, progress can be made in reducing homelessness and ensuring that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing.
