Homelessness is a prominent issue in American society, receiving significant attention from policymakers and the general public. Despite the relatively small percentage of the population that experiences homelessness on any given night, the issue remains a top priority for voters and garners more Google searches than other social problems like inequality, racism, poverty, and climate change. This disproportionate interest in homelessness can be attributed to two potential explanations: underestimation of the true size of the homeless population and the incongruity of homelessness in the wealthiest country in the world.

While official estimates of homelessness only account for a fraction of the actual population, a more expansive definition suggests that millions of Americans are affected by homelessness at some point in their lives. However, even this larger figure highlights the fact that only a small fraction of people living in poverty actually become homeless. The intense interest in homelessness may stem from the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are living without housing in a country with significant wealth and resources.

There are two main explanations for the regional variation in homelessness rates across the United States. One explanation focuses on individual factors such as addiction, mental illness, poverty, and eviction as the causes of homelessness. The other explanation looks at larger structural forces like market conditions, housing costs, racism, discrimination, and inequality. While both explanations have some validity, the book argues that housing market conditions, specifically the costs and availability of housing, are the primary drivers of regional variation in homelessness rates.

The book examines the variation in per capita homelessness rates across different cities and counties in the United States. It finds that housing market conditions, particularly rent levels and rental market vacancy rates, explain the differences in rates of homelessness. Cities with higher per capita homelessness rates tend to have higher housing costs and lower vacancy rates, making it more difficult for low-income individuals and families to find and afford housing. This finding challenges common narratives that attribute homelessness to individual factors and suggests that housing market conditions play a critical role.

The book also considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement on homelessness. The pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of unhoused populations and the risks of falling into homelessness for precariously housed individuals. The movement for racial justice has drawn attention to the structural and systemic factors, including racism, that contribute to homelessness, particularly for marginalized communities.

The book concludes by proposing a comprehensive approach to ending homelessness in the United States. This approach involves changing public perception, increasing resources from all levels of government, and adopting a systems approach that addresses the entire homelessness system from prevention to crisis response to permanent housing solutions.

Overall, the book aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the causes and solutions to homelessness in the United States, highlighting the role of housing market conditions in driving regional variation in homelessness rates. By challenging common narratives and offering evidence-based insights, the book seeks to contribute to a better understanding of homelessness and inform effective policy responses.
