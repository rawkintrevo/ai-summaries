Chapter 3 of the book discusses the process of building applications powered by GPT-4 and ChatGPT models. It provides an overview of app development using language models and discusses key considerations such as API key management, security, data privacy, and software architecture design. 

The chapter provides several examples of how these models can be used in different applications. The first example is building a news generator solution, where GPT-4 is used to generate news articles based on a list of facts. The chapter provides code snippets and explains the steps involved in creating such a tool.

The second example is summarizing YouTube videos. The chapter explains how to extract the transcript from a YouTube video and how to use GPT-4 to summarize the transcript. Code snippets and instructions are provided to guide the reader through the process.

The third example is creating an expert for Zelda BOTW (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) using ChatGPT. The chapter explains how to use Redis as a data store to store and retrieve information for the expert. It also provides code snippets and instructions for building the expert and integrating it with ChatGPT.

The fourth example is creating a voice control personal assistant using ChatGPT and the Whisper library for speech-to-text conversion. The chapter explains how to use Whisper to transcribe audio files and how to use ChatGPT to interact with the user based on their voice input. Code snippets and instructions are provided for building the personal assistant and integrating it with Whisper and ChatGPT.

Overall, the chapter demonstrates the versatility and power of GPT-4 and ChatGPT models in building intelligent applications. The examples provided cover a range of use cases and provide practical guidance for integrating these models into real-world applications.
