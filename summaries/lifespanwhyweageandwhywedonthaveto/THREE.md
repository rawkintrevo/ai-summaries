In the first section of the book, the author sets the stage for the idea that aging itself is a disease. He describes a meeting at the Royal Society in 2010, where scientists gathered to discuss the concept of aging as a disease. The attendees presented research that challenged the conventional wisdom about aging and argued that it should be viewed as a disease process with a broad spectrum of pathological consequences. The author emphasizes that aging is not just a natural part of life, but rather a disease that can be treated and prevented.

The author then discusses the law of human mortality, which states that the probability of dying increases exponentially with age. He explains that this is why aging is the greatest cause of diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's. However, he points out that society has largely ignored aging as a disease and focuses instead on treating individual diseases one by one. The author argues that this approach is ineffective and costly, and instead proposes a new approach that treats aging itself as the primary target.

The author presents evidence to support the idea that aging is a disease. He discusses the physical decline that occurs with aging, the increase in chronic diseases, and the specific pathological process of aging. He also challenges the notion that aging is inevitable and irreversible, and argues that it is a treatable condition. The author suggests that if society viewed aging as a disease, similar to cancer or diabetes, more resources would be devoted to finding effective treatments and preventative measures.

The author concludes the first section by discussing the need for a new approach to treating aging as a disease. He argues that current medical interventions focus on individual diseases and do not address the underlying cause of aging. He proposes a new framework that addresses the hallmarks of aging, such as telomere deterioration, proteostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The author suggests that by targeting these hallmarks, it may be possible to slow down or even reverse the aging process.

Overall, the first section of the book argues that aging is a disease that can be treated and prevented. The author presents evidence to support this idea and proposes a new approach to treating aging as a primary target. The book challenges conventional wisdom about aging and advocates for a shift in the way society views and addresses the process of aging.
