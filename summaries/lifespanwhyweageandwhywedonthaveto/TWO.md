In this document, the author discusses the Information Theory of Aging, which suggests that aging is caused by changes in the epigenome, rather than changes in the actual DNA sequence. The author explains that epigenetic noise, caused by factors such as DNA damage and stress, disrupts the stability of the epigenome and leads to aging. The author describes how the survival circuit, which includes molecules like sirtuins, helps cells repair DNA damage and maintain stability in the epigenome. However, over time, the constant activation of the survival circuit leads to a loss of information and disruption of the epigenetic landscape, resulting in aging. The author also highlights how various organisms, such as bristlecone pine trees and jellyfish, have evolved mechanisms to resist aging and maintain their cellular identity. The author discusses the importance of stabilizing the epigenome to prevent aging and suggests that interventions like exercise and NAD-boosting molecules can help regulate the survival circuit and maintain epigenetic stability. Overall, the author argues that understanding the Information Theory of Aging can open up new possibilities for extending human lifespan and improving overall health in old age.
