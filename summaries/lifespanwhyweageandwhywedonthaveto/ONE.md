In this excerpt, the author paints a picture of the early days of Earth, “about 4 billion years ago,” and the emergence of life from a harsh and unforgiving environment. They describe the formation of the world’s first RNA molecules, the predecessors to DNA, and the formation of microscopic soap bubbles as the first cell membranes. They describe the evolution of life from these primitive forms into more advanced organisms, surviving droughts and cosmic rays, until eventually arriving at the “great survivor,” a unique organism with a distinct genetic survival mechanism. 

The author then goes on to describe the evolution of aging. They reject the idea that aging occurs for the “good of the species,” as was once commonly believed, and instead propose that aging occurs due to a loss of information. They describe the two types of information in biology: digital information, stored in DNA, and analog information, stored in the epigenome. They explain that the loss of analog information, rather than genetic mutations, is the primary cause of aging. They introduce the concept of the Information Theory of Aging, which suggests that by understanding and manipulating genes that control the aging process, such as sirtuins, TOR, and AMPK, it may be possible to slow down aging and extend healthy lifespan.

The author emphasizes the potential of these longevity genes and pathways to transform medicine and society, suggesting that they may change the way we define our species. They discuss the ongoing research and development of drugs and interventions that can activate these genes and pathways, mimicking the benefits of exercise and fasting. They conclude by expressing their belief that finding a universal explanation for aging is possible, and that reversing aging may be achievable through understanding and restoring lost information.
