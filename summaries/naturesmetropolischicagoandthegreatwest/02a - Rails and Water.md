The article discusses the role of transportation infrastructure, specifically railroads and waterways, in the development of Chicago in the 19th century. It argues that while natural advantages such as the city's location on the Great Lakes and its access to waterways were important, it was human intervention and artificial corridors that played a crucial role in shaping the city and its growth.

The article begins by highlighting the cultural and historical factors that influenced the development of Chicago. It suggests that geographical arguments alone cannot explain the transformation of a French-Anglo-Indian fur-trading village into a booming American city. Instead, it argues that people's cultural values and history played a significant role in reshaping the landscape to fit their vision.

The article then focuses on the challenges posed by Chicago's natural geography, specifically the mouth of the Chicago River and the shallow harbor. Early attempts by the government and soldiers to dig a new channel to improve navigation were unsuccessful, and the harbor continued to present problems. The article highlights the efforts made by Chicagoans to overcome these obstacles, such as building piers and dredging the harbor, but notes that nature constantly posed new challenges.

The article goes on to discuss the broader concept of "second nature," which refers to the human manipulation and improvement of the natural landscape. It argues that in the case of Chicago, second nature played a crucial role in shaping the city's growth and its transportation corridors. Despite the boosters' initial belief that rivers and lakes would be the main avenues of trade, it was ultimately railroads that played a more important role in building Chicago and other cities in the Great West.

The article describes the difficulties faced by farmers in transporting their produce to Chicago due to the state of the roads and the limitations of horse-drawn wagons. It notes that the muddy conditions during the wet seasons and the limitations of the wagons made it difficult for farmers to transport their goods over long distances. However, the article suggests that despite these challenges, farmers recognized the economic advantages of bringing their crops to Chicago, where they could receive better prices and have access to a wider range of goods.

The article then explores the role of railroads in connecting Chicago to its surrounding region and the impact they had on the city's growth. It discusses the construction of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad and how it expanded Chicago's access to its hinterland. The article also highlights the role of other railroads in Chicago's growth, such as the Illinois Central, which played a significant role in connecting the city to the Gulf of Mexico, and the various branch lines that extended Chicago's reach into the surrounding agricultural lands.

The article concludes by emphasizing the transformative power of railroads and how they shaped Chicago's development. It suggests that while waterways played an important role in promoting urban growth, it was the railroad that ultimately allowed Chicago to fulfill its natural destiny as the interior metropolis of the continent. The article argues that railroads became the new emblem of progress and prosperity and had a profound impact on the city's economy and landscape.

Overall, the article provides a detailed analysis of the role of transportation infrastructure, specifically railroads and waterways, in the development of Chicago in the 19th century. It highlights the challenges and obstacles faced by the city and its residents and emphasizes the transformative power of railroads in shaping the city's growth and prosperity.
