The concept of empire and the role of cities in achieving imperial status are central themes in the writings of 19th-century boosters in America. Boosters believed that the destiny of the West lay in the rise of a central city that would lead the region and become an empire in itself. They drew on historical references to ancient cities like Rome and believed that Chicago could become the new Rome of the New World. The boosters saw empire as a metaphor for greatness and saw the development of urban centers as a means of achieving imperial status.

The concept of empire was deeply ingrained in American patriotism during this time, with the idea that the western expansion of the United States was consistent with the historical trajectory of empires that had come before. Boosters saw the westward expansion as the continuation of an empire's journey, with each empire being symbolized by a central city. They believed that the future of America and the West was inseparable from the growth and greatness of its central city.

The boosters frequently invoked classical sites and made comparisons to ancient empires to lend grandeur and significance to their own cities. They saw their cities as successors to the great civilizations of the past and believed that their empires would surpass those of Europe and the American East. They saw themselves as part of a grand historical progression of empire, with their cities poised to become the new centers of power and influence.

The boosters also used the metaphor of the tributary countryside to describe the relationship between the central city and the surrounding rural areas. They believed that the countryside would pay tribute to the city, much like how Rome received tribute from its conquered territories. This tribute would come in the form of resources and wealth, which would further fuel the growth and greatness of the city. The boosters saw this relationship as mutually beneficial, with the city providing markets and opportunities for rural areas to prosper and vice versa.

While the boosters' rhetoric may seem at odds with the ideals of republicanism and democracy, they saw no contradiction between the two. They believed that the imperial nature of their cities was based on free trade and commerce rather than on tyranny or exploitation. They saw the relationship between city and country as one of mutual benefit, where both parties would prosper and grow through their commercial interactions.

The boosters' vision of empire and the central city as the focal point of economic and social progress was at odds with the writings of historian Frederick Jackson Turner. Turner viewed the frontier as a rural place that existed in isolation from the city, and saw cities as the culmination and end of the frontier. However, there is a connection between Turner's frontier thesis and the boosters' vision of empire. Both recognize the importance of the city and its relationship with the rural hinterland in shaping the history and development of the Great West.

Turner's frontier and the boosters' urban empire are two sides of the same coin, with the frontier being the expanding edge of market activity and the metropolitan city being the center of that activity. The boosters' vision of empire aligns with the central place theory proposed by Johann Heinrich von Thünen, which describes how market relations shape the landscape and economy of a region. Von Thünen's theory helps to explain the growth and development of cities in the Great West and the interconnectedness between city and country.

In conclusion, the concept of empire and the role of cities in achieving imperial status were central themes in the writings of 19th-century boosters in America. They saw the central city as the focal point of economic and social progress, and believed that it would lead the region to greatness. The boosters drew on historical references and used metaphors to lend grandeur to their cities and to emphasize their vision of empire. While their vision may seem at odds with democratic ideals, they saw the relationship between city and country as one of mutual benefit and believed that their cities would become centers of commerce and prosperity. The boosters' vision of empire aligns with the central place theory proposed by von Thünen and helps to explain the interconnectedness between city and country in the Great West.
