In the epilogue of "Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West," author William Cronon reflects on his personal connection to the subject matter of the book. Growing up in Wisconsin in the 1960s, Cronon had a limited view of Chicago and saw it as a dangerous and unnatural place. He did not appreciate the extent to which his own life depended on the city and its markets. As he grew older, he realized the importance of Chicago as a gateway to the Great West and how it shaped the region's history.

Cronon discusses the decline of Chicago's gateway status and the limitations that the city faced. Congestion and other challenges made it difficult for Chicago to maintain its dominance as a gateway city. Other urban centers emerged in the West, competing with Chicago and capturing more of its hinterland. The rise of meat-packing in Omaha and Kansas City, as well as the development of other industries in different locations, contributed to Chicago's decline.

The author also explores the connection between Chicago and pastoral retreats in Wisconsin. Many wealthy Chicagoans sought escape from the city in resorts and vacation homes in rural areas like Lake Geneva and Green Lake. These areas became part of Chicago's recreational hinterland, providing a sanctuary for the city's residents. Cronon reflects on his own childhood experiences at Green Lake and how they were connected to the larger history of Chicago and its relationship with the countryside.

Cronon argues that the urban and rural landscapes are interconnected and interdependent. The market economy of the city relies on resources and labor from the countryside, while the countryside depends on the city for markets and services. He emphasizes the moral responsibility that comes with understanding this connection and the need to consider the impact of urbanization on the environment and people living in the countryside.

In closing, Cronon notes that every city is nature's metropolis and every countryside its rural hinterland. The dichotomy between urban and rural is a false one, as they are intertwined and influenced by each other. He concludes that true sustainability requires recognizing and addressing the interdependence of urban and rural areas, and the shared responsibility to care for both.
