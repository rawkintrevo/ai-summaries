In the late 19th century, the contrasting experiences of city and country were evident in the perceptions of visitors to the Chicago World's Fair. Rural tourists were both attracted and repelled by the metropolitan atmosphere of the fair and the city itself. While some were awestruck by the grandeur and opportunities of the city, others were overwhelmed by the noise, confusion, and vice they encountered. One young girl from a small town in Wisconsin described the city as chaotic and overwhelming, comparing it to the Tower of Babel. However, she was also impressed by the department stores, mansions, and suburbs of the city, which seemed far more luxurious and desirable than her rural hometown.

Despite the attractions of the city, many rural visitors were apprehensive about the perceived dangers of crime and vice. Early newspaper reports warned of pickpockets, thieves, and confidence men that were believed to be prevalent at the fair. Tourists feared being robbed or taken advantage of by the dishonest city dwellers. The fear of crime and vice was further perpetuated by popular books and publications, such as "The Adventures of Uncle Jeremiah and Family at the Great Fair," which depicted rural visitors falling victim to scams and dangerous situations in the city. These fears were not unfounded, as there were indeed areas of poverty and crime in Chicago that contrasted with the luxurious displays of the fair.

The fear of crime and vice in the city was rooted in a long-standing rural anxiety about the perceived dangers and corruptions of urban life. Rural residents viewed the city as a place of moral decay and saw its inhabitants as dishonest and immoral. They saw the city as a threat to their values and way of life, and feared that their children would be corrupted by its vices. This fear was amplified by the rapid growth and industrialization of cities like Chicago, which seemed to be leaving rural areas behind.

In response to these fears, there was a renewed emphasis on the virtues of rural life and the importance of maintaining a strong agricultural sector. Agricultural publications and organizations promoted the benefits of country living and urged young people to stay on the farm. They argued that rural life was more moral, wholesome, and economically viable than the city. They advocated for improvements in rural education, better farming techniques, and the formation of cooperatives to protect farmers from the perceived exploitative practices of urban markets.

However, the reality of rural life was often more difficult than the idealized image presented by these publications. Farming was hard work with low wages, and many young people were attracted to the opportunities and pleasures of the city. The rural areas also faced their own challenges, including declining populations, lack of infrastructure, and limited economic opportunities. The idea that farming would provide a better life for young people was not always reflected in the economic realities of the agricultural sector.

Despite the challenges and contradictions, the relationship between city and country was complex and intertwined. The city relied on the rural areas for food and resources, while the rural areas depended on the city for markets and economic opportunities. There were also cultural and social exchanges between the two, as rural residents visited the city for the fair and urban residents sought out the countryside for leisure and retreat.

In the end, the experiences of city and country were not as distinct and separate as they initially seemed. Both were shaped by the forces of modernization and industrialization, and both faced challenges and opportunities in their own ways. The urban and rural divide was a subject of both fear and admiration, as each side sought to understand and navigate the changing world around them. Ultimately, the contrasting experiences of city and country at the Chicago World's Fair reflect the larger tensions and complexities of American society in the late 19th century.
