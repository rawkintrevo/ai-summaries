In this piece, the author discusses the development of Chicago as a metropolitan center and its impact on the surrounding region. The author emphasizes the interconnectedness between the city and its hinterland, highlighting the economic and ecological transformations that occurred as a result. The author also explores the hierarchy of urban settlements, noting that Chicago's role as a gateway city allowed it to dominate the regional economy and serve as a hub for trade and commerce.

The author begins by describing the physical infrastructure of Chicago in the late 19th century, including grain elevators, lumberyards, and stockyards. These structures were symbols of the city's wealth and power, but they also obscured the environmental and economic relationships that underpinned their existence. The author argues that the city's growth and prosperity depended on its ability to extract resources from the surrounding countryside and convert them into marketable goods.

The author then delves into the concept of "second nature," which refers to the human-made systems and structures that shape the environment. The author argues that Chicago's development as a metropolis required the imposition of a new human order on the natural world, resulting in a hybrid system that was both artificial and natural. This second nature was shaped by the demands of the urban marketplace and had significant ecological and economic consequences.

The author also explores the role of capital flows in shaping Chicago's hinterland. By analyzing bankruptcy and probate court records, the author traces the movement of capital between the city and its surrounding region. The author highlights the interconnectedness of the urban and rural economies, with Chicago serving as a hub for trade and finance. The author also notes the influence of New York City on Chicago's development, as the two cities worked together to create a regional economic system.

The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the urban-rural relationships that defined Chicago's hinterland. The city's growth and prosperity were dependent on the resources and markets provided by the surrounding region, and the region itself was shaped by the demands of the city. The author argues that one cannot fully understand the economic and environmental history of the region without considering the impact of Chicago's development.

Overall, the author provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the development of Chicago as a metropolitan center and its impact on the surrounding region. The author highlights the interconnectedness of urban and rural economies and explores the ecological and economic consequences of Chicago's growth. The author's analysis is based on a variety of sources, including court records and historical accounts, and provides a rich and nuanced understanding of the subject matter.
