The World's Columbian Exposition, also known as the Chicago World's Fair, was held in Chicago in 1893 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World. The fair was a massive undertaking and showcased the progress of American civilization, particularly that of Chicago, the host city. The fairgrounds covered almost two square miles and included grand buildings, such as the Manufactures building, which was the largest such structure on earth at the time. The fairgrounds were illuminated with thousands of lamps, demonstrating the wonders of electricity.

The fair was given the nickname the "White City" because of the white plaster and jute fiber that covered the buildings, creating a classical and aesthetically pleasing appearance. The buildings were divided into categories, with each one displaying representative inventions and treasures from around the world. The fair was seen as a symbol of American progress in the face of a troubled economy and social unrest, and visitors, both local and international, were captivated by its grandeur.

The fair attracted a wide range of visitors, from foreign tourists to ordinary working-class people. It started slowly in terms of attendance but gained momentum as word spread about its magnificence. By the end of the fair, over twelve million people had visited, with many returning for multiple visits. The majority of visitors were from Chicago and its surrounding areas, and the fair's attendance record was set on "Chicago Day," when three-quarters of a million people celebrated at the exposition. Visitors from rural areas and small towns were also drawn to the fair, and each state had its own exhibition building that residents would visit to see how it compared to others.

The fair was seen as a revelation of beauty and a celebration of progress, with visitors being awe-struck by its grandeur and the advancements on display. The fair was often compared to a utopia, a place that inspired feelings of religious fervor and a sense of wonder. It was praised for its architectural beauty, cleanliness, and peaceful atmosphere. Many visitors believed that the fair represented the pinnacle of civilization and that it showcased the achievements of the 19th century.

The fair's ties to the city of Chicago were also highlighted, particularly in relation to the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The fire, which devastated a large part of the city, had been seen as a major setback. However, it was also seen as a turning point, as it led to the rebuilding of the city with stricter fire prevention measures and the development of taller, fire-resistant buildings. The fair's connection to the fire was seen as symbolic of Chicago's ability to rise from the ashes and achieve greatness.

Overall, the World's Columbian Exposition was a significant event in Chicago's history and played a crucial role in shaping the city's identity. It showcased the city's ambition, progress, and resilience, and left a lasting impact on both its residents and visitors. The fair's grandeur and beauty captured the imagination of all who attended, and its success was seen as a testament to the greatness of the 19th century.
