In the preface of Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West, written by William Cronon, the author states that the book is not a comprehensive history of Chicago or the Great West, but rather a history of the relationship between the two. Cronon believes that Chicago played a significant role in shaping the landscape and economy of the midcontinent during the second half of the nineteenth century and that understanding the growth of Chicago requires understanding its special relationship with the region to the west.

Cronon argues that during the second half of the nineteenth century, the American landscape underwent significant transformations that anticipated many of the current environmental problems we face today, including deforestation, species extinction, and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. At the same time, this period also saw the creation of the integrated economy in the United States, which bound city and country together into a powerful national and international market. Cronon believes that understanding the economic and ecological transformations that took place during this time is crucial to understanding the history of North America and the rest of the world.

The author acknowledges that Americans often view city and country as separate places, but argues that in reality, they are closely interconnected. Cronon believes that city and country have a common history and their stories are best told together. He organizes the book around the topic of commodity flows, specifically the movement of grain, lumber, meat, and other trade goods between Chicago and its hinterland during the second half of the nineteenth century. Cronon acknowledges that economic history is not widely read, and he aims to make his text exciting and accessible to readers who may find commodity markets mysterious or boring.

Cronon notes that his book focuses on commodity flows and does not delve into other topics typically covered in urban history, such as neighborhood growth, social conflicts, or political machines. He also does not focus on individual men and women, except for merchants who exemplify the broader city-country connections he wishes to trace. Cronon acknowledges that his book may not cover all aspects of Chicago's history, but he hopes that by focusing on the links between the city and its natural resources, he can offer insights into the larger story of Chicago and the Great West.

In terms of terminology, Cronon explains that he uses the term "Great West" to refer to the vast interior region of the United States that was neither the North nor the South during the nineteenth century. He acknowledges that the term "frontier" is controversial due to its ideological implications, but argues that it is necessary to use it because it closely relates to the expansion of a metropolitan economy into peripheral regions. Cronon also admits that the word "nature" is complex and ambiguous, and he uses it to refer to both the nonhuman world and the complex mingling of natural and artificial elements that humans inhabit.

Cronon expresses his gratitude to various institutions and individuals who supported his research, including libraries, archives, and fellow scholars. He also acknowledges the influence of his mentors, teachers, and his family in shaping his passion for history. He concludes by thanking his wife and daughter for reminding him of the importance of connecting history to the present world.
