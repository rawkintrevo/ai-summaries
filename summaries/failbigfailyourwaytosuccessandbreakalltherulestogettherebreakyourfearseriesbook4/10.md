Chapter Nine of the book discusses the fear of failure and how it is connected to the fear of rejection. The chapter begins by stating that fear is a dominating force that can prevent individuals from taking action and lead to a permanent obstacle to success. When fear is believed more than the possibility of success, fear wins and individuals fail by default. The author mentions J.K. Rowling, who highlights that it is impossible to live without failing at something unless one lives so cautiously that they might as well not have lived at all.

The fear of failure is then defined as atychiphobia, which is an abnormal, unwarranted, and persistent fear of failure. This fear can lead to a constricted lifestyle and keeps people from participating in activities that could potentially lead to failure. The fear of failure has a voice that suggests negative beliefs to individuals, such as "you're just a stupid person," "you don't have what it takes to get ahead," and "everything I've tried I gave up on after the first try." These fears reinforce the fear of failure through avoidance and evasion, which ultimately leads to self-sabotage and living in a prison of one's own making.

The chapter then discusses the fear of rejection and how it stems from a core belief that one is not worthy. People who struggle with rejection often have low self-esteem and place little value on themselves. Rejection can occur in various areas of life and can lead to feelings of devaluation, shame, and unworthiness. The author emphasizes that rejection begins internally and is often a result of self-rejection rather than external rejection from others.

To overcome the fear of rejection, the author suggests desensitizing oneself to the fear by facing rejection head-on. This can be done by making rejection a daily habit and putting oneself in situations where rejection is likely. By doing so, individuals can numb the emotional pain associated with rejection. The author also advises individuals to stay centered in their own emotional playground and not let the emotions of others dictate their own. Additionally, the chapter encourages individuals to let go of past failures that define them and to build rejection-free confidence through practice and taking action. 

The chapter concludes by stressing the importance of taking action and not letting fear of failure win. It emphasizes that failure can only defeat those who allow it to, and the real risk is in doing nothing. The chapter encourages individuals to break the fear of failure and live their dreams as they were meant to. It emphasizes the importance of having an unbreakable mindset and resilience in the face of fear.
