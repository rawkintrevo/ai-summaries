In this chapter, the author discusses the mindset traits of successful failures, or individuals who have experienced failure but have used it as a stepping stone to success. The author emphasizes that these traits are not exclusive to high-level achievers and can be implemented by anyone to achieve their goals.

Trait #1: Successful Failures Embrace Risk: Successful failures understand that taking risks is an integral part of the process. They acknowledge the fear of failure but proceed anyway, knowing that they can handle whatever happens.

Trait #2: Successful Failures Perceive Failure as a Lifelong Strategy: Failure is not seen as an endpoint or a permanent state by successful failures. Instead, they view it as an obstacle or a momentary setback that they can overcome with perseverance and continuous self-improvement.

Trait #3: Successful Failures Embrace Rejection: Rejection is a natural part of the journey towards success, and successful failures understand this. They do not take rejection personally but instead perceive it as a response to the product or idea being presented, not an evaluation of themselves as individuals.

Trait #4: Successful Failures Persevere in the Moments of Resistance: Successful failures understand that success is not immediate and requires time, practice, and persistence. They do not give up when faced with challenges or setbacks but instead use them as opportunities to learn and grow.

Trait #5: Successful Failures Form New Habits: Successful failures develop and maintain habits that most people avoid or overlook. These habits include time blocking, waking up early, setting priorities and goals, reading consistently, maintaining focus, and investing in mindset development.

Trait #6: Successful Failures are Vision Focused: Successful failures have a clear vision of what they want to achieve. They can see beyond the current challenges and focus on the bigger picture, which drives their perseverance and commitment to their goals.

Trait #7: Successful Failures Focus on a Master Goal: Successful failures set big, audacious goals that may seem impossible to achieve. They create milestones and commit to long-term planning to work towards these goals. These goals are built on their life's mission and provide a strong reason to keep going, even in the face of failure.

Trait #8: Successful Failures Eliminate Excuses: Successful failures do not make excuses to avoid taking action. They recognize and challenge their own excuses, knowing that they are rooted in fear and self-sabotage. They take responsibility for their choices and prioritize their dreams over self-doubt.

Trait #9: Successful Failures Focus on Purpose and Meaning: Successful failures have a deep sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. This sense of purpose drives their actions, removes fear, and helps them prioritize their goals. They believe in what they do and are committed to fulfilling their mission.

The author encourages readers to work on developing these traits and not worry if they haven't mastered them yet. The traits can be cultivated over time and will continue to evolve as individuals work through the material.
