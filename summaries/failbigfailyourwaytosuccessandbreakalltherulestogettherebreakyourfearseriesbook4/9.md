In this chapter, the author explores the concept of self-defeating behavior and how it can hinder success in various aspects of life. They highlight two common types of self-defeat: feeling like a failure despite outward success, and living beneath one's potential due to self-limiting beliefs. The author emphasizes that self-defeat is often rooted in childhood experiences of criticism, undervaluation, comparisons, and feelings of inferiority. These experiences shape a person's belief that they are a failure, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy of never feeling like their accomplishments are enough. 

The author acknowledges that self-defeat can manifest in different ways, such as imposter syndrome. They also point out that many people engage in self-sabotaging behaviors like drug or alcohol use as a means of escape. Even successful individuals may be plagued by self-defeat internally while appearing competent and confident on the outside. The author encourages readers to confront their self-defeating behaviors and make a commitment to change.

To overcome self-defeat, the author recommends several strategies. Firstly, they suggest rewriting one's personal story, focusing on the present and future rather than dwelling on past failures. They advise visualizing where one wants to be in the future and taking action to make that vision a reality. Taking responsibility for one's actions and choices is also seen as crucial for personal growth and empowerment. The author suggests visiting one's inner child and offering love and compassion as a way to heal from past wounds and embrace self-growth. Practicing gratitude is recommended as a means of shifting focus away from what is lacking and towards what is already present. Finally, the author emphasizes the importance of honesty and self-acceptance, acknowledging and learning from mistakes, and setting boundaries with individuals who bring negativity and drag one down.

The author concludes by providing a list of takeaways for defeating self-defeat. These include treating oneself and others with compassion, recognizing achievements and talents, practicing positive self-talk, identifying and addressing weaknesses, identifying patterns of self-sabotage, taking cautious steps to face avoided challenges, and cultivating deep gratitude for what one has. The chapter ends on a hopeful note, encouraging readers to make a commitment to overcome self-defeat and create lasting change in their lives.
