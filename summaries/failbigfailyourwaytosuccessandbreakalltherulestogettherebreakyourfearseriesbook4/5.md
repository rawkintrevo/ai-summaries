In Chapter Four of the book, the author discusses six limiting beliefs that hinder personal growth and success. The chapter begins by emphasizing the importance of beliefs in shaping one's mindset and determining future actions. The author explains that empowering beliefs can open doors and make the seemingly impossible possible, while limiting beliefs can weigh one down and prevent progress. The author encourages readers to examine their beliefs and recognize the ones that are holding them back.

The first limiting belief discussed is the belief that success is only possible with the right skills, education, or privileged background. The author argues that while these factors can play a role, they do not determine one's ultimate success. To support this claim, the author provides examples of successful individuals who came from humble backgrounds or lacked resources. The key is to believe in oneself and one's abilities, regardless of external circumstances.

The second limiting belief is the idea that one's life is at the mercy of external events. The author suggests that one's mindset and attitude towards failure play a crucial role in turning failure into a learning opportunity. Instead of feeling powerless, one should focus on what can be controlled and take responsible action. The author quotes Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor, who emphasized the importance of choosing one's attitude in any given situation.

The third limiting belief is the fear of failure and the belief that failure can be avoided by playing it safe. The author argues that avoiding risks means saying no to progress and personal growth. The author discusses Bronnie Ware's observations of dying patients who regretted not having the courage to live life true to themselves, instead of conforming to others' expectations. The author urges readers to reflect on their own lives and consider the regrets they might have if they continue to play it safe.

The fourth limiting belief revolves around the idea that once a failure, always a failure. The author emphasizes that failures are not permanent and that one should not let past failures define future success. The author provides examples of famous individuals who faced failures but eventually succeeded. The key is to silence the negative internal monologue and believe in one's ability to overcome setbacks.

The fifth limiting belief is the belief that one lacks talent, skill, creativity, or special abilities. The author challenges this belief by highlighting the importance of hard work and perseverance. Talent may be a natural advantage, but skills can be learned and developed through effort. The author encourages readers to embrace the growth mindset and believe that they can succeed with hard work.

The final limiting belief discussed is the belief that if one hasn't succeeded by now, they never will. The author argues that success takes time and effort, and the focus should be on progress rather than the end result. The author provides examples of famous individuals who faced numerous failures before achieving success. It is important to believe in oneself and continue pushing forward.

To change these limiting beliefs, the author provides a six-step process. The process involves identifying the belief, introducing doubt and uncertainty, reframing the belief, visualizing the desired outcome, reinforcing the new belief through action, and regularly reviewing and updating one's belief system.

In conclusion, Chapter Four of the book explores six limiting beliefs that hinder personal growth and success. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing and challenging these beliefs in order to break free from self-imposed limitations and achieve one's goals.
