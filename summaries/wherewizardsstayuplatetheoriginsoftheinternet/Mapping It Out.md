In December 1966, Larry Roberts arrived at the Pentagon without any knowledge of Donald Davies' work in packet switching or Paul Baran. Roberts had previously attended a conference in 1964 where he decided to work on communications between computers. In 1965, Roberts oversaw an experiment to connect the TX-2 computer to the SDC Q-32 using a special Western Union four-wire full-duplex service. The experiment allowed the machines to send messages to each other. However, the results were mixed with reliability and response time issues.

Roberts realized that bringing together different computers was challenging, especially for the project he was working on at ARPA. He had a wide circle of colleagues, one of whom was Leonard Kleinrock. Kleinrock had influenced Roberts in his early thinking about computer networks and had worked on the theoretical models of communication networks. Roberts gave Kleinrock a contract to set up the Network Measurement Center at UCLA.

Roberts and Kleinrock were also friends outside of work and were inveterate casino gamblers. They developed schemes for blackjack counting and even tried to predict the outcome of roulette using a small machine they built. However, their plans were cut short when they started winning and drew attention from casino detectives.

Roberts recognized the need for a fast response time for the upcoming network. He wanted to avoid the sluggishness of existing time-sharing systems. At a meeting of ARPA's principal investigators, Roberts proposed connecting all time-sharing computers directly over dial-up telephone lines. However, there was little enthusiasm for this idea. Wes Clark suggested inserting a small computer, called an Interface Message Processor (IMP), between each host computer and the network. This idea received more positive feedback and Roberts decided to send out a request for proposals to build the IMP.

Roberts was introduced to the work of Donald Davies through a paper presented by Roger Scantlebury at a conference in Gatlinburg. Davies and Scantlebury's work on packet switching influenced Roberts' design of the network. Roberts also learned about Paul Baran's work at RAND from Scantlebury and later consulted him during the design of the network.

Roberts finalized the requirements for the network and released a request for proposals. IBM and Control Data Corporation declined to bid, claiming that the network could never be built. Roberts considered using the PDP-8 minicomputer from Digital Equipment Corp, but most of the bids proposed using the Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer.

After receiving over a dozen bids, Roberts entered into final negotiations with Raytheon, a major defense contractor. However, just before Christmas, ARPA announced that the contract to build the Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was awarded to Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), a small consulting firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Overall, Larry Roberts played a crucial role in the development and design of the early computer network, overseeing experiments, and making key decisions. His collaboration with colleagues like Leonard Kleinrock and Wes Clark, as well as the influence of researchers like Donald Davies and Paul Baran, contributed to the evolution of computer networking.
