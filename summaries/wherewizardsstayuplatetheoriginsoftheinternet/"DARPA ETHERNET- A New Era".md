In the 1970s, discussions had begun about DARPA divesting operational responsibility for the ARPANET, as it was becoming a drain on other priorities. The goal was to maintain a networking research effort, but sell off the network itself to a private contractor. AT&T was approached but declined due to compatibility issues with their network. Some engineers left BBN to form a company called Packet Communications Incorporated, while BBN itself considered buying the network and setting up a subsidiary to operate it. Eventually, BBN recruited Roberts to run a new subsidiary called TELENET, which would market a private packet-switching service. The ARPANET was temporarily transferred to the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) and later sold to them permanently. Roberts struggled to find a successor at DARPA, eventually asking Licklider to return to take the role. BBN had control over the network and was hesitant to release the source code for the IMP, causing tension between BBN and network researchers. After appealing to DARPA, BBN agreed to provide the code to anyone who asked, charging a nominal fee. In 1975, DCA took over network management from DARPA and BBN continued as the contractor for network operations. DARPA was able to focus on developing the new CATENET protocols while DCA handled operational policy. Cerf joined DARPA as a program manager and worked on refining the TCP protocol, leading to the split between TCP and IP. Metcalfe, working at Xerox PARC, developed Ethernet, a local-area network that connected computers in different rooms. The system used a collision detection method to manage traffic on the network, and it proved successful in connecting Xerox's personal computers.
