The document is the beginning of a book about the history of the internet. It starts by describing a reunion of the scientists and engineers who designed and built the ARPANET, the network that would become the prototype for the internet. The reunion is being held to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the installation of the first network node. Many of the attendees had not seen each other in years and were excited to reconnect. One of the attendees, Bob Taylor, is on a personal mission to correct a misconception about the ARPANET. There is a widespread belief that the network was built to protect national security in the event of a nuclear attack, but Taylor wants to set the record straight. He knows that the true purpose of the ARPANET was to link computers at scientific laboratories for the purpose of sharing resources, not for war-related reasons.

The narrative then switches to a description of Bob Taylor's daily routine. He drives to work at the Pentagon in his BMW 503, parks in one of the vast parking lots, and walks to his office on the third floor. Taylor is the director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). His office is located in the Pentagon's D-ring, away from the offices of the high-ranking officials. Inside his office, there is a terminal room with three computer terminals connected to different mainframe computers at various locations across the country. Each terminal is an extension of a different computing environment and requires different log-in procedures and commands. Taylor finds this setup frustrating and wants to find a way to connect all the different machines.

The document ends with a description of the growing sense of community among the computer research community in the mid-1960s. Despite the diverse projects and computer systems, researchers were forming tight bonds and beginning to communicate through electronic mail on their mainframe computers.

Overall, the document introduces the reunion of the ARPANET pioneers and sets the stage for the exploration of the history of the internet. It also highlights the personal mission of Bob Taylor to correct the misconception about the purpose of the ARPANET. The document provides descriptions of the daily routine and office setup of Bob Taylor, as well as the emerging sense of community within the computer research community.
