In the early 1960s, two researchers named Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently came up with the idea of packet-switching. Baran, an immigrant from Eastern Europe, was working at RAND Corporation on the survivability of communications systems under nuclear attack. He believed that current communication networks were too vulnerable and came up with the concept of a distributed network that was composed of many nodes redundantly connected to each other. He also proposed the idea of splitting messages into parts, or message blocks, and sending them through the network individually. Baran faced resistance from AT&T officials who found his ideas preposterous. Despite this, he continued to develop his ideas and wrote a series of technical papers to address objections and explain his proposal. The Air Force eventually agreed to support his research and development program. 

Meanwhile, in London in 1965, Donald Davies, a physicist at the British National Physical Laboratory, came up with a similar idea for a computer network. His motivation was to create a new public communications network that could handle the bursty nature of computer-generated data traffic. Davies focused on configuring the data blocks, called packets, and envisioned the need for an intermediary device that could bridge the gap between different computer systems. He received support from the British telecommunications establishment and sought funding for an experimental network at NPL. Davies chose the word "packet" to describe the small pieces of data that traveled separately through the network.

Baran and Davies, though they worked independently and on different goals, arrived at the same revolutionary idea of a new kind of communications network. Baran's work focused on survivability in the event of a nuclear attack, while Davies' work aimed to create a more efficient network for computer-generated data traffic. Both proposed the idea of packet-switching, where messages are split into packets and sent through the network individually, allowing for faster and more efficient communication.

Throughout their work, Baran and Davies faced skepticism and resistance from those who believed their ideas were impossible or impractical. AT&T officials dismissed Baran's ideas as nonsense, and Davies faced opposition from authorities in charge of the British Post Office's telephone service monopoly. However, both researchers persisted and continued to develop their ideas. Baran wrote comprehensive technical papers to address objections and explain his proposal, while Davies sought funding and support for an experimental network at NPL.

In the end, both Baran and Davies made significant contributions to the development of packet-switching, which eventually revolutionized the way information is transmitted and laid the foundation for the creation of the internet. Baran's concept of a distributed network with redundant connections and Davies' idea of splitting messages into packets were instrumental in the development of modern computer networks. Despite their different motivations and approaches, Baran and Davies' work converged on the same innovative solution, demonstrating how ideas in science and technology can evolve and revolutionize the field.
