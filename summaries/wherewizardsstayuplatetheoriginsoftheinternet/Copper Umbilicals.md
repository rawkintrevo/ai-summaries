In the early 1970s, electronic mail (e-mail) was still a relatively new and niche form of communication. Traffic reports showed that the volume of e-mail on ARPANET, an early version of the internet, was minuscule compared to the volume of regular mail in the United States. However, companies in the private sector were beginning to recognize the potential of e-mail, with companies like MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab and the U.S. Geological Survey adopting the technology.

The growth of e-mail was not going unnoticed by the government either. A report for the White House estimated that 30% of all first-class mail would be sent electronically within a few years. The U.S. Postal Service awarded RCA a contract to evaluate the feasibility of providing e-mail service and a USPS advisory panel recommended making a "firm and continuing commitment" to electronic mail. Even Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign in 1976 used e-mail as a means of communication.

However, there were still debates and discussions within the e-mail community. The MsgGroup, a group of e-mail users, engaged in discussions about topics such as time and date stamps, privacy, and the etiquette of e-mail communication. There were occasional clashes and "flaming" incidents, where users would engage in heated and sometimes abusive dialogue. Despite these disagreements, the e-mail community was seen as a virtual community, where people formed friendships and had lively discussions.

Bob Kahn, who had been involved in the development of ARPANET, began to envision the possibility of creating a network of networks. He saw the potential of linking different networks, such as the ARPANET, packet-radio networks, and satellite networks. This idea led to the formation of the International Network Working Group (INWG), which aimed to create an international network of networks.

The INWG worked on developing a "Concatenated Network" or CATENET, which would allow for the interconnection of networks with different technologies and speeds. This would enable communication between different networks and increase the reach and accessibility of the internet. The British and French were also working on expanding their national research networks and were enthusiastic about the idea of network interconnection.

Overall, the late 1970s saw the continued growth and potential of e-mail, as well as the development of ideas for expanding the internet and connecting different networks. The discussions and debates within the e-mail community reflected the evolving nature of this new form of communication, with users grappling with privacy concerns, etiquette, and the use of technology in communication.
