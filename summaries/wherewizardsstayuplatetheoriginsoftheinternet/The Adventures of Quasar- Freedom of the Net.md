In 1975, an electronic discussion group called the Message Services Group (MsgGroup) was formed on the ARPANET, a predecessor to the internet. The group was an early network mailing list and served as a platform for the network community to discuss and develop message services. The group was moderated by Einar Stefferud, who manually remailed messages to all participants. The discussions in the group lasted for ten years and covered a wide range of topics related to message services.

One of the major debates in the group was about message headers. Some programmers and mail programs included a lot of information in their headers, while others advocated for simplicity and less information overload. The ideal program, according to some members, would allow users to design their own headers. The discussion eventually led to the publication of RFC 724, a proposed standard for the format of ARPA Network messages. However, this standard faced criticism and was later revised and published as RFC 733.

Another significant development during this time was the creation of the computer game Adventure. The game was initially developed by Will Crowther, an avid cave explorer, and was later refined by Don Woods. Adventure became incredibly popular and inspired many other computer games. It showcased the appeal of an open networking culture and the power of sharing and collaboration.

In 1977, a controversy known as the Quasar robot debate emerged in the MsgGroup. Quasar Industries had developed a programmable domestic android robot and made claims about its capabilities and functionalities. However, some members of the group suspected that the robot was a hoax. The debate sparked a discussion about using the ARPANET to openly criticize a private company. While some members felt it was important to speak out, others urged self-censorship to avoid potential legal issues.

The debate over free speech in cyberspace highlighted the tensions between the open and free-flowing nature of the network and the need for responsible use. Some members expressed concerns about the potentially libelous material being shared on the ARPANET and the consequences it could have for the network's future. Ultimately, the debate did not reach a resolution, but it showcased the deep stake that the networking community felt in shaping the future of the network.

Overall, the creation of the MsgGroup and the discussions within it demonstrated the evolving nature of the ARPANET and its users. It showed the power of collaboration and sharing ideas, but also the challenges of navigating issues like information overload, standards, and responsible use. The MsgGroup served as a microcosm of the expanding network community and its collective efforts to shape the future of communication on the ARPANET.
