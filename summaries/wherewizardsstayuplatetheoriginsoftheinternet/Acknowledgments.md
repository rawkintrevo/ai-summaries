The book that is being referenced in this document is about the creation of the original ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. The idea for the book originated with engineers at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), who wanted to document their significant role in the creation of the ARPANET. The book was a collaborative effort, with BBN opening its archives and providing funding for the project. The company did not exercise any control over the content of the book.

Several individuals and organizations played a crucial role in the development of the book. Marian Bremer, BBN's head librarian, made the initial phone call that led to the project. Cary Lu and John Markoff, among others, encouraged the authors to take on the endeavor. The MIT archives and the Charles Babbage Institute at the University of Minnesota provided valuable assistance, as did Kevin Corbitt, an assistant archivist.

The authors conducted numerous interviews with key figures in the creation of the ARPANET. These interviews included Wes Clark, Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn, Severo Ornstein, Bob Taylor, Larry Roberts, Jon Postel, Frank Heart, Alex McKenzie, Dave Walden, Ben Barker, Donald Davies, Paul Baran, Len Kleinrock, Steve Lukasik, Steve Crocker, and Bob Metcalfe. Others, such as Louise Licklider, Bill McGill, John Swets, and Karl Kryter, shared their memories of J.C.R. Licklider and his contributions. Mitch Waldrop also provided additional information.

The authors received support and information from various sources throughout the writing process. Phil Patton entrusted them with his copy of the Barber Associates study. They consulted with experts such as Brian Reid, Gary Chapman, Kevin Buckley, Dave Farber, and Colonel Clair Shirey. Marsha Longshore of IEEE sent technical articles, and Earl Swartzlander shared his copies of the IEEE computer history annals. Steve Wolff helped them understand the events of the 1980s, particularly regarding NSF's role in the development of the Internet.

The manuscript went through several stages of completion and was read by a number of individuals, including Vint Cerf, Lyman Chapin, Steve Crocker, Peter Denning, Frank Heart, Bob Kahn, John Kelley, Larry Landweber, Steven Levy, Hank Long, Paul McJones, Alex McKenzie, Peter Preuss, Larry Roberts, Einar Stefferud, Bob Taylor, John Vittal, Dave Walden, and Susan Zacharias. The authors also had the help of Everett Hafner, their research assistant, and Andrea Perry, the proofreader.

The authors express their gratitude to several individuals who provided support and advice throughout the process. ZoÃ« Mark Lyon provided moral support and humor, while Denny Lyon, Amy Goodwin, Kelly McRee, Ellen Lyon, and Jeremy Lyon helped with childcare. Sherry Turkle, Sarah Hafner, Teresa Carpenter, Terry Evers, Robert Wallich, Tony Bianco, and Carol Flake offered a sympathetic ear. Others, such as Ladd Hanson, Mark McFarland, George Hackett, Bob Berdahl, Ann Walther, Lindsey Lane, Tom Ferguson, and Paulina Borsook, provided assistance and insights when needed.

The authors also acknowledge the help they received during their travels, including housing provided by Chris Paine, Katherine Magraw, Holly Myers, Kirk Neely, Lisa Van Dusen, Candace Thille, Julie Graham, Debbie Yager, Katherine and Irving Gottsegen, Jane and Frank Heart, Barry Muhlfelder, Jane Anderson, and Eric Ponteri.

They express their gratitude to their literary agents, John Brockman and Katinka Matson, who recognized the potential of the book. Bob Bender, the editor at Simon & Schuster, played a crucial role in shaping the book, and his assistant, Johanna Li, provided unwavering support.

The document concludes with the contact information of the authors, Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon, and their respective email addresses.
