This book originated from an idea conceived by engineers at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) in 1993. The goal was to record the significant role that BBN played in the creation of the original ARPANET. The company opened its archives to the authors and provided funding for the project.

The authors express their gratitude to various individuals and institutions that assisted them in their research. Marian Bremer, BBN’s head librarian, initiated the project. Cary Lu and John Markoff encouraged the authors to take on this endeavor. The authors also received help from Helen Samuels and the MIT archives, Kevin Corbitt from the Charles Babbage Institute, and the Wired magazine team.

Several individuals were interviewed at length for this book, including Wes Clark, Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn, Severo Ornstein, Bob Taylor, Larry Roberts, Jon Postel, Frank Heart, Alex McKenzie, Dave Walden, Ben Barker, Donald Davies, Paul Baran, Len Kleinrock, Steve Lukasik, Steve Crocker, and Bob Metcalfe. Additionally, the authors received memories and insights from people who knew J.C.R. Licklider, including Louise Licklider, Bill McGill, John Swets, and Karl Kryter. Mitch Waldrop also provided helpful information. Phil Patton shared his copy of the Barber Associates study, and various experts such as Brian Reid, Gary Chapman, Kevin Buckley, Dave Farber, and Colonel Clair Shirey offered their expertise on relevant topics.
