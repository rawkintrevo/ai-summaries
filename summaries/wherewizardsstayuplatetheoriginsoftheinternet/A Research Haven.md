The document describes the history and founding of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which was established by President Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launch of the first Sputnik satellite in 1957. The agency was created to support academic research and prevent technological surprises. The document introduces Neil McElroy, a former soap salesman who was appointed as Secretary of Defense by Eisenhower. McElroy was not a scientist or soldier, but he recognized the importance of scientific research and was committed to advancing technology. The document explains how McElroy visited the Redstone Arsenal, home of the Army's rocket program, and learned about the Soviet launch of Sputnik while talking to Wernher von Braun, the father of modern rocketry. This event marked a turning point in American history, as it challenged the nation's confidence and ignited fear and despair. President Eisenhower was determined to address the issue and called on his science advisors for their expertise. He appointed James R. Killian Jr., president of MIT, as his science advisor. The document highlights Eisenhower's appreciation for the scientific community and his desire to have a single high-level science advisor to assist him with technology decisions. The document also discusses how the Soviet launch of Sputnik prompted discussions about the establishment of an independent agency for research. McElroy and Killian began discussing the idea of creating ARPA, which would be responsible for advanced research projects. The document outlines how ARPA was initially met with resistance from the military, as they believed the agency would infringe on their territory. However, Eisenhower supported the creation of ARPA and emphasized the need for civilian control of military research. In early 1958, ARPA was officially established, with Roy Johnson serving as its first director. The document explains how ARPA's mission changed over time, shifting its focus to basic research and high-risk projects. The agency attracted top talent from universities and research laboratories, and it became known for its freewheeling, open approach to research. The document concludes by highlighting the important role that ARPA played in advancing military science and technology during the Cold War era.
