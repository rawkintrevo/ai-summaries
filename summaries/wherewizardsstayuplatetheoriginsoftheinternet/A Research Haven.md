The document highlights the origins and early history of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The agency was established by President Dwight Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957. ARPA was intended to be a fast-response research agency closely tied to the president and secretary of defense, in order to prevent future technological surprises.

The document introduces Neil McElroy, a soap salesman who became the secretary of defense and played a key role in the establishment of ARPA. McElroy, who had no military experience, saw the agency as a way to centralize and manage research and development programs, reducing the intense rivalries among branches of the military.

The document describes the panic and fear that spread across America after the launch of Sputnik, with many people believing that the Soviet Union posed a significant threat to national security. President Eisenhower, who had a deep appreciation for the scientific community, held meetings with prominent scientists to discuss the impact of Sputnik and to seek their advice. He appointed James R. Killian Jr., the president of MIT, as his science advisor, who would later play a key role in the creation of ARPA.

ARPA was officially established in 1958, with Roy Johnson, a businessman, as its first director. However, the agency initially struggled to find its purpose and faced opposition from the military, as it encroached on their territory. The document explains how ARPA underwent a transformation, shifting its focus to basic research and becoming a champion for high-risk, high-gain projects. This new direction was supported by the scientific community and aligned with the changing attitudes towards science and technology in Washington.

The document describes the appointment of Jack P. Ruina as the second director of ARPA in 1961. Ruina brought a relaxed management style and decentralized structure to the agency, prioritizing finding talented individuals and giving program directors freedom to pursue their projects. Under Ruina's leadership, ARPA's budget increased and it embarked on projects related to ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection.

Overall, the document provides a detailed account of the early days of ARPA and its evolution from a response to the Sputnik crisis into a champion of high-risk, high-gain research. It highlights the key figures involved in the creation of the agency and the challenges they faced in establishing its purpose and securing support.
