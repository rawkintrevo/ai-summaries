In the early 1970s, Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf began working on the idea of creating a seamless connection among different networks. They believed that a "gateway," or routing computer, would be necessary to hand off messages from one network to another. However, they faced the challenge of standardizing packet transmission among networks with different interfaces, packet sizes, and transmission rates. They also realized that the reliability of these networks would vary, so they needed a new protocol that could cope with autonomous networks while still allowing hosts on different networks to communicate with each other. They eventually developed a protocol called TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) that encapsulated and decapsulated messages in "data-grams" and shifted the responsibility of reliability from the network to the destination hosts. This new protocol enabled communication across different networks and paved the way for the future of networking.

As the ARPANET expanded, more resources became available, and network usage increased. Users could access news, databases, and remote computing resources. The introduction of terminal IMPs and the establishment of the ARPANET News and USING (an users' interest group) further facilitated the use of the network. However, communicating and using remote resources remained cumbersome, and there was a demand for higher-level application programs to simplify these processes.

DARPA, the agency overseeing the ARPANET, faced tensions related to the network's military connections and the political unrest of the time. There were concerns about the use of the network for nuclear attack scenarios and the storage of seismic information for Pentagon projects. Additionally, allegations arose that Army intelligence officers had used the ARPANET to move files, leading to a Senate investigation and the need for DARPA to explain the network's usage. Ultimately, DARPA was able to clear its name and prove that the files had not moved on the ARPANET.

Overall, the development of TCP and the expansion of the ARPANET laid the foundation for modern networking. The ability to connect different networks and transfer information using standardized protocols revolutionized communication and opened up new possibilities for collaboration and resource sharing. The ARPANET was becoming more user-friendly, and its potential for connecting people and resources across different sites was becoming increasingly apparent.
