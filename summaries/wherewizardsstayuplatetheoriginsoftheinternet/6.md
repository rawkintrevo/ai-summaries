The passage discusses the early years of the development of the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. In 1969, the network was small and consisted of only four nodes on the West Coast. However, the goal was to connect universities and research institutions across the country. The network faced challenges, including budget cuts and difficulties in acquiring new machines. Nevertheless, Larry Roberts, the director of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office, was determined to expand the network and gain support from other institutions.

The ARPA network team at BBN Technologies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, played a crucial role in the development of the network. They worked on improving the design of the Interface Message Processors (IMPs), the devices that connected the host computers to the network. The team also developed remote maintenance and diagnostic capabilities for the IMPs, allowing for troubleshooting and fixing of the machines from a distance. This technology was crucial as it ensured that the network could function efficiently and be monitored for any issues.

To ensure the network's reliability, the team at BBN designed features to detect and fix problems remotely. For example, they developed loopback tests that could isolate sources of trouble by sending test traffic through the various components of the network. They also added logging capabilities and warning lights to the message processors, allowing them to detect and predict line trouble. These features allowed BBN to work closely with the telephone company to identify and fix line issues.

As the network expanded, BBN established a Network Control Center to monitor and manage the network. Initially a small corner of an office, the center grew in importance as the network grew in size. The IMP Guys, as they were known, developed software to compile status reports from the IMPs and identify any issues. They also connected a spare machine as a host machine to process the network status reports more efficiently.

By 1970, the network had expanded to include several more machines and institutions. BBN had to deal with logistical issues, such as delays and faulty equipment from Honeywell, the company manufacturing the IMPs. BBN began inspecting each new machine before accepting delivery to ensure their quality. Despite these challenges, the network continued to improve, with regular software upgrades and efficient maintenance procedures.

The passage also mentions the cultural changes happening at BBN during this time. The company's growth and increased focus on defense contracting led to the construction of a new headquarters building designed like a fortress. BBN's Network Control Center was located on the fifth floor, overlooking a logical map of the network. The control center played a crucial role in managing the network, issuing software upgrades, and maintaining the system's reliability.

Overall, the passage provides an overview of the early development of the ARPANET and highlights the importance of BBN's contributions to the network's success. The team at BBN developed innovative technologies and techniques to ensure the network's reliability and efficiency, laying the foundation for the internet as we know it today.
