The passage tells the story of Bob Taylor, a man who started his career in the U.S. Navy and eventually became the director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Taylor's interest in computing began while he was in graduate school, where he realized that computing research was a rewarding field. After working in the aerospace industry, Taylor joined NASA as a program officer, where he was invited to join a committee headed by J.C.R. Licklider. Licklider's ideas about interactive computing greatly influenced Taylor, and when he became the director of IPTO, he decided to pursue the idea of building a computer network. 

The motivation behind Taylor's idea for a network was to solve the problem of researchers duplicating and isolating costly computing resources. The funding for computer resources was growing faster than Taylor's budget, and every new project required setting up a new and expensive computing operation. Taylor believed that by building a network, researchers doing similar work in different parts of the country could share resources and results more easily. Taylor pitched his idea to Charles Herzfeld, the director of ARPA, who was immediately convinced by the cost-cutting and reliability advantages of a network. 

Taylor contacted Larry Roberts, a computer scientist from Lincoln Lab who had a reputation for being a genius and a strong manager. Roberts initially declined Taylor's job offer, but after a call from the director of Lincoln Lab, he accepted the position. Roberts had already done experimental work on networking, and he had a clear idea of how to build a network. He meticulously sketched out network diagrams and began planning the layout and technical details of the network. 

The passage also provides some background information on the history of communication networks. It mentions the development of telegraph networks, the monopoly of AT&T in the telecommunications industry, and the resistance to new technology within the Bell System. AT&T was reluctant to allow any new devices or technologies to be added to its system, and it sued companies like the manufacturer of the Hush-A-Phone and an undertaker who was giving out plastic phone-book covers. This background information serves to highlight the challenges and resistance that Taylor and Roberts faced in building their network.
