In the mid-1970s, the National Science Foundation (NSF) emerged as a potential source of funding and support for the academic computer science community. The NSF was interested in creating a network for computer scientists and had previously raised the issue in a 1974 report. However, at that time, nothing came of the idea. By the late 1970s, the advantages of the ARPANET, such as rapid communication and resource-sharing, were becoming clear, and computer science departments were growing rapidly.

The lack of access to the ARPANET was causing a divide in the computer research community, with only 15 out of 61 ARPANET sites located at universities. This resulted in a disadvantage for research institutions without access to the network, as they struggled to attract top scholars and research grants. Moreover, there was a growing concern that the exodus of computing talent from academia to industry would hinder the training of the next generation of computer scientists.

To address these issues, Larry Landweber, head of the computer science department at the University of Wisconsin, proposed the creation of a new network for computer science researchers called CSNET. The network would be open to researchers in academia, government, and industry, and would use a commercial service provider like TELENET. It would be less expensive than the ARPANET and would be run by a consortium of eleven universities. The proposal received enthusiastic praise and was sent to the NSF in November 1979.

However, after peer review, the NSF rejected the proposal but remained enthusiastic about the CSNET idea. A workshop was then sponsored to overcome the deficiencies found in the proposal. In the summer of 1980, a new proposal was developed that involved a three-tiered structure consisting of ARPANET, a TELENET-based system, and an e-mail-only service called PhoneNet. The NSF agreed to support CSNET for a five-year startup period, with funding provided by user fees. The network would be managed by the NSF for the first two years and then handed off to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.

By June 1983, over seventy sites were online and connected to CSNET. At the end of the five-year period, nearly all computer science departments and private computer research sites in the country were connected. The network was financially stable and self-sufficient. The success of CSNET paved the way for more NSF ventures in computer networking.

In the mid-1980s, additional networks began to emerge, such as BITNET, UUCP, USENET, and NASA's SPAN. These networks gradually came to be known as the "Internet" due to their ability to communicate using TCP/IP protocols. The distinction between "internet" and "Internet" was made, with the former referring to any network using TCP/IP and the latter specifically referring to the public network that was made up of linked networks using TCP/IP.

At the same time, private corporations and research institutions were building networks using TCP/IP. The market for routers began to grow, and the distinction between gateways and routers became blurred. Academic research networks also began to form in Europe and Canada.

In 1985, the NSF created NSFNET, a backbone network that interconnected supercomputer centers around the United States. Regional networks were formed around the country, and the NSF provided the backbone network as a "free good" to the academic community. The success of NSFNET demonstrated the importance of networking to the scientific community.

Throughout this time, there was a battle between TCP/IP and the OSI Reference Model for network interconnection standards. The OSI model was backed by entrenched bureaucracy and governments in Europe, while TCP/IP had gained popularity and adoption in the American culture of the Internet. Eventually, TCP/IP prevailed due to its simplicity and practicality.

Overall, the development of the Internet relied on the collaboration and efforts of various individuals, organizations, and networks. The use of TCP/IP as the core protocol and the open nature of its development were key factors in its success.
