In the early 1980s, the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) was created as a separate transfer mechanism for email, as the original file-transfer protocol was not suitable for the growing complexity of email processing. The development of the domain name system (DNS) also became necessary due to the increasing number of host machines connected to the network. In 1983, the core DNS team, including Jon Postel, Paul Mockapetris, and Craig Partridge, worked on developing a hierarchical addressing scheme for the DNS, which included seven top-level domains such as edu, com, gov, etc. The DNS was a significant change in how the Internet was organized, and its implementation was delayed due to debates over the hierarchy sequence and domain names.

In 1989, the Internet started to gain traction outside of the scientific and academic communities. This was evident at the Interop trade show, where companies like Novell, Synoptics, and Network General spent significant amounts of money on exhibitions. This indicated that the Internet was being adopted by businesses, and it became clear that TCP/IP had become widely used and was the preferred protocol. The NSFNET program further democratized networks, and by the late 1980s, more computers were connected via the NSFNET than the ARPANET. The ARPANET, which cost $14 million a year to run, was deemed outdated and was decommissioned. The sites on the ARPANET were transferred to the NSFNET backbone or regional networks, marking the end of the ARPANET by 1989.

The decommissioning of the ARPANET symbolized the growth and transformation of the Internet. The success of TCP/IP over the official OSI standard demonstrated that standards should be discovered rather than decreed. The NSFNET became the Internet's backbone, connecting an increasing number of computers around the world. The 1990s marked a turning point for the Internet, as more people gained access to it through the NSFNET and the regional networks it spawned. The ARPANET's demise paved the way for further advancements in networking technology.
