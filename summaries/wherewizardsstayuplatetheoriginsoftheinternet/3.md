In 1948, Richard Bolt and Leo Beranek started a consulting company, Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), primarily focusing on acoustics. They had expertise in airborne acoustics, noise control, and noise reduction in buildings. They were hired to design the acoustics for the United Nations’ new complex of buildings in New York City, which proved to be a success. The demand for their services grew, and they consulted on acoustical systems for various buildings around the country. They also worked on projects like reducing noise from a large wind tunnel near Cleveland and analyzing audio tapes for important events such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the Watergate scandal.

In the late 1950s, Leo Beranek recruited J.C.R. Licklider, a professor at MIT, to join BBN. Licklider had an interest in human-machine interaction and saw potential in the computing field. He believed that computing would play a crucial role in scientific research and convinced Beranek to invest in a computer for BBN. They purchased an LGP-30, a relatively slow and low-memory machine, which Licklider used for statistical calculations and psychoacoustics experiments.

During this time, Ken Olsen, founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, visited BBN and lent them a prototype of the PDP-1 computer. BBN eventually bought the first commercial PDP-1, marking their entrance into computer technology. The presence of the PDP-1 attracted notable computer scientists, including Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, who were pioneers in artificial intelligence.

BBN became known as "the third university" in Cambridge, after MIT and Harvard, due to its academic environment and talented staff. The company's architectural-acoustics division faced a crisis when Leo Beranek was criticized for overlooking important acoustical principles in the design of Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center. The hall required extensive repairs, but BBN's focus had shifted towards computer research, which saved the company from potential failure.

BBN hired Frank Heart, a computer systems engineer from MIT's Lincoln Lab, to oversee a project introducing computer technology into hospitals. Heart had a knack for building efficient systems and had experience in connecting computers with measuring devices. He joined BBN and played a crucial role in the company's computer research. BBN's computer research was split into two divisions: information sciences and computer systems. The divisions worked separately and had little collaboration.

Despite this division, Heart saw potential in applying computers to various fields, including the life sciences. He had a "dogooder’s" view that computers and technology could benefit society. He also had a chance to make money at a private corporation, which influenced his decision to join BBN.

In summary, Bolt Beranek and Newman started as an acoustics consulting company but ventured into computer research with the purchase of the LGP-30 and PDP-1 computers. They attracted talented computer scientists and became a prominent player in the Cambridge research community. Despite facing challenges, BBN's focus on computer technology saved the company and allowed them to explore various applications of computers in different fields.
