In 1975, an electronic discussion group called the MsgGroup was formed on the ARPANET, with the goal of developing a long-term strategy for message services on the network. The group consisted of around one hundred participants who exchanged thousands of messages over the course of ten years. The MsgGroup was one of the first network mailing lists and became a platform for discussing various topics related to message services. One major point of contention was the format of message headers, with some programmers advocating for more information and others arguing for simplicity.

In 1977, a new mail standard called RFC 724 was proposed, outlining the format of ARPA network messages. However, the response from the computing community was lukewarm, with many criticizing the emphasis on officialness and questioning the need for a strict standard. In response to the criticism, a revised edition of the standard, RFC 733, was published, which clarified that it was strictly a definition of what should be passed between ARPANET hosts and not a dictate on the look and feel of message programs.

One of the most popular mail programs on the ARPANET at the time was MSG, created by John Vittal. MSG allowed users to manage their messages more easily by organizing them into folders and introducing features like the ANSWER command for replying to messages. MSG gained widespread popularity and became the de facto standard for mail programs on the network.

In addition to discussions about message services, the ARPANET was also used for various other activities, including playing computer games. One notable example was a game called Adventure, created by Will Crowther. Adventure was a text-based fantasy role-playing game that became incredibly popular on the network. Hundreds of knockoffs were created, spawning an entire industry and inspiring many programmers to get involved in computing.

The ARPANET also faced its first major controversy in 1977 when a company called Quasar Industries introduced a robot called the Domestic Android. The robot received a fair amount of press attention, but there were doubts about its claims. Members of the MsgGroup debated whether it was appropriate to criticize the robot using the ARPANET, as it was taxpayer-funded. Some argued for self-censorship to avoid potential legal issues, while others believed in the importance of freedom of speech.

The debate highlighted the strong sense of ownership and community within the networking community. Participants felt a deep stake in the creation of the network and wanted to ensure its future. The discussion also demonstrated the importance of free speech and the need to protect the network from unwanted supervision.

Overall, the formation of the MsgGroup on the ARPANET in 1975 and the subsequent discussions and controversies within the group shed light on the early days of network communication and the development of protocols and standards. The group played a crucial role in shaping the future of message services on the network and highlighted the values and principles of the networking community.
