BBN, a computer company, received a request for proposals from ARPA to build the Interface Message Processor (IMP) for a new network project. Frank Heart, a manager at BBN, was tasked with leading the project. Although Heart initially had concerns about the risk and feasibility of the project, he ultimately agreed to take it on. Heart was known for his high energy and enthusiasm, although he could be difficult to interpret at first due to his loud and passionate demeanor. He was intensely loyal to his employees and took things personally when people left his group. 

The project faced many uncertainties and challenges. There were software uncertainties and the network as a whole had no precedent, making it difficult to estimate the risks involved. Other unknowns included handling traffic and failures within the network. Additionally, the project required a certain amount of faith since it was pushing the boundaries of technology. Despite these challenges, Heart believed that BBN had the skills and expertise to successfully complete the project. 

Heart formed a small team at BBN to work on the proposal. One member of the team was Bob Kahn, a professor of electrical engineering who had been sending technical memos to ARPA. Kahn had been independently thinking about networking and was eager to get involved in the project. Other key members of the team included Dave Walden, who brought expertise in real-time systems, and Will Crowther, a talented programmer. 

The team at BBN worked tirelessly for four weeks to write a detailed proposal. They designed the IMPs, outlined test programs and performance checks, and provided flowcharts and equations to demonstrate the feasibility of the project. The proposal was more detailed than any other, costing over $100,000. The team submitted the proposal to ARPA, confident in the thoroughness of their work. 

After submitting the proposal, the team had to wait for months to hear back from ARPA. They heard rumors and second-guessed their chances of winning the contract. However, in the end, ARPA awarded the contract to BBN. The team at BBN was relieved and grateful for the opportunity. The project was seen as groundbreaking and presented many challenges, but the team was ready to take them on. 

BBN's win was celebrated, even receiving a telegram from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy congratulating the company. The project was seen as an exciting venture into a new era of computing and networking. The BBN team was excited to begin the work of building the IMPs and making the network a reality.
