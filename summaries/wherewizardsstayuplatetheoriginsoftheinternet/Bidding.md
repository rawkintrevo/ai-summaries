In 1968, BBN Technologies received a request for proposals from ARPA to build the Interface Message Processor (IMP), a critical component of the ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet. Frank Heart, the Division Director at BBN, believed that the company should bid on the project and appointed Wesley Clark to manage it. Heart felt that Clark was the best person for the job due to his extensive experience in building computer systems. However, Clark was cautious and unsure about taking on the project.

Heart was known for his high energy and enthusiasm, though it could sometimes come across as yelling and shouting. Despite his intensity, Heart was a loyal and nurturing boss who took things personally, especially when people left his group. He was concerned about the risks involved in committing the company to the IMP project, as there were many uncertainties and unknowns. Heart fretted about the software uncertainties, as well as the system's overall capabilities and reliability.

Jerry Elkind, Heart's superior at BBN, believed that participating in the project would push the company into a new era of computing. Elkind suggested that a small group from BBN convene to decide how to respond to ARPA's proposal. Heart agreed, and they began working on a detailed proposal. One of the first individuals to join the team was Bob Kahn, a professor of electrical engineering who had been working on networking concepts at BBN. Kahn had coincidentally been sending technical memos to the ARPA team, and when he learned they were planning to fund a nationwide network, he jumped at the opportunity. Kahn's expertise in communications and information theory made him a valuable addition to the team.

As the team at BBN worked on the proposal, they encountered various technical challenges and uncertainties. They grappled with issues such as traffic handling, system failures, and the overall functionality and reliability of the network. Despite these challenges, Heart and his team were confident in their abilities to build the IMP and make the network succeed. They presented a detailed and comprehensive proposal to ARPA, which outlined the design, software, and performance expectations of the network.

The BBN proposal stood out due to its thoroughness and lack of bureaucracy. Heart ensured that a small, tightly knit team worked on the project, reporting directly to him. This simplicity and efficiency appealed to Larry Roberts, the head of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office overseeing the project. Roberts was impressed with the level of detail and forethought put into the BBN proposal.

After a period of waiting and uncertainty, ARPA awarded the contract to BBN to build the IMP. The team at BBN, including individuals like Dave Walden, Will Crowther, and Bob Kahn, celebrated their success. They had overcome doubts, uncertainties, and risks to secure one of the most important contracts in the history of computer networking.

BBN began working on the IMP project immediately, selecting the Honeywell DDP-516 as the hardware platform. The team focused on designing software and code that would enable the IMPs to handle traffic, maintain reliability, and provide a transparent user experience. They made significant progress in the early stages of the project, particularly in writing efficient code that could process packets quickly and accurately.

The BBN team's dedication and expertise helped them overcome the challenges they encountered during the development of the IMP. Their ability to think creatively and solve complex problems was evident throughout the project. Despite the pressure and immense responsibility, the team remained focused on their mission to build a reliable and efficient network.

In conclusion, BBN Technologies, under the leadership of Frank Heart and with the expertise of individuals like Wesley Clark, Bob Kahn, and Will Crowther, successfully won the contract to build the Interface Message Processor for the ARPANET. Their thorough proposal, technical knowledge, and commitment to excellence set them apart from other contenders. The project marked a significant milestone in the history of computer networking and paved the way for the development of the Internet as we know it today.
