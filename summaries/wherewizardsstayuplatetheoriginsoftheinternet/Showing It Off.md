In the fall of 1971, the ARPA network carried an average of just 675,000 packets per day, barely utilizing even 2% of its capacity. The network served mainly as a testbed for the computer research community, and its potential had yet to be realized by most users. Larry Roberts, a key figure in the development of the network, realized that a public demonstration was needed to spread awareness of its potential.

Roberts enlisted Bob Kahn to organize the demonstration, which was scheduled for October 1972 at the International Conference on Computer Communication in Washington. Kahn, along with Al Vezza, traveled across the country to recruit participants and plan the demonstration. They met with vendors in the computer industry and asked them to bring their own terminals to connect to the network. The plan was to run demonstrations on as many machines as possible, showcasing the network's resources to conference attendees.

The preparations for the demonstration were intense, with teams of students and researchers working to finalize the network tools and protocols. The ICCC demonstration was intended to put pressure on the community to make sure the network would be functioning flawlessly by the designated date. The network equipment and people arrived at the hotel where the conference was being held and began setting up. The room was filled with terminals and cables as technicians worked to ensure everything was connected and functioning properly.

On the day of the preview demonstration for VIPs, there was a moment of panic when packets were being lost due to a glitchy line in the network. The operators at the Network Control Center quickly removed the link, restoring the flow of packets. Despite this hiccup, the preparations continued, and the conference officially opened the next day.

During the conference, attendees were given a scenarios book that described various demonstrations and provided instructions on how to connect to the network and use its resources. However, many found the book confusing, and there were instances of people accidentally crashing the system or experiencing other technical difficulties. Despite these challenges, the conference showcased the potential of packet-switching technology and its ability to enable resource-sharing and real-time communication.

Some of the demonstrations included conversational programs that engaged users in verbal dialogue. One, called PARRY, mimicked the belief system of a paranoid psychotic, while another called the Doctor mimicked the behavior of a psychiatrist. These programs demonstrated the lifelike quality of conversations that could be had over the network.

Overall, the ICCC demonstration was successful in establishing the viability of packet-switching and the potential of the ARPANET. It showcased the network's capabilities and sparked excitement within the computer research community. The event proved that resource-sharing over a network was possible, leading to a greater sense of community and the recognition of electronic mail as a valuable tool within the network.
