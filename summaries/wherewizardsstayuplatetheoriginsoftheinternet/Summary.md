In this passage, the author discusses the significance of the Internet in the mid-nineties and the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the installation of the first ARPANET node at UCLA. The author explains that the Internet had grown from a research experiment into a household word, with more people using it for various purposes such as communication, entertainment, and business. Analysts believed that the Internet held great marketing potential. The World Wide Web, a multimedia branch of the Internet, had been created in 1990, making it easier for people to navigate with point-and-click programs. The Mosaic browser, created in 1993, played a big role in popularizing the Internet.

The author then delves into the history of the Internet and the personalities involved in its creation. Larry Roberts, Frank Heart, Steve Crocker, Bob Kahn, and Vint Cerf are mentioned as key figures in the development of the Internet. The author emphasizes how the personalities and proclivities of these individuals shaped the Net. BBN (Bolt Beranek and Newman), the company responsible for building the ARPANET, had faced financial troubles in the 1980s and a legal dispute with the government over contract overcharges. However, BBN saw the celebration of the ARPANET's 25th anniversary as an opportunity to polish the company's image.

The author goes on to describe the planning of the event, the guest list, and the marketing strategy behind it. The CEO of BBN, George Conrades, saw the party as a marketing vehicle and wanted it to be a grand celebration of BBN's pioneering role in the Internet. The public relations firm hired by BBN came up with the theme "History of the Future" to suit Conrades' plans of expanding BBN's Internet-related businesses. The event generated media coverage, including articles in Newsweek and the Boston Globe and a video news clip aired on local newscasts.

The author then provides a detailed account of the party itself, including the arrival of the guests of honor, photo sessions, press conferences, and speeches. The ARPANET pioneers mingled and reminisced about their involvement in the early days of the Internet. The author highlights the multiple claims to credit for the creation of the Internet and the conflicting views on the commercialization of the Net. The original pioneers believed that the networking revolution would rank among the most important technological changes of the century.

The passage ends with the guests saying their goodbyes and checking out of the hotel, with a sense of optimism and satisfaction about the celebration. The author concludes by mentioning the absence of Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Marc Andreessen, the co-programmer of Mosaic, who were behind the two inventions that were already making a significant impact on the Internet. The author also mentions that while some of the pioneers had become wealthy, others had not, and that Vint Cerf was particularly celebrated during the event.
