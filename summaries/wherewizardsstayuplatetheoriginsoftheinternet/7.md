In 1973, Len Kleinrock, one of the pioneers of network communication, discovered the potential of email when he used the ARPANET to retrieve a forgotten razor from his colleague, Larry Roberts. This incident highlighted the power of the network for personal communication, and soon email became a popular tool among the early users of the ARPANET. However, the ARPANET was not initially designed for email; it was intended for resource-sharing. As email usage grew, it became clear that a separate mail system was needed.

The first email programs were written by Ray Tomlinson and were initially used only within individual PDP-10 machines. Tomlinson realized that email could be sent across multiple machines and modified his program to enable this. This breakthrough allowed email to cross the wider network and created the first interconnectivity. Other programmers soon developed their own email programs based on Tenex, the operating system most commonly used on the ARPANET.

However, as email usage increased, so did the need for standardization. There were issues with incompatible mail programs and operating systems, which resulted in garbled messages or formatting errors. An ad hoc committee led by Abhay Bhushan attempted to standardize email headers to bring some order to the implementation of new email programs. Headers were the top part of each email message and contained information such as the time sent, the route traveled, and the recipients. However, a lack of adherence to these standards caused conflicts among different machines and operating systems.

The diversity of non-standard systems on the ARPANET led to problems such as disagreements over the use of the @ sign in addresses. The @ sign had been chosen by Ray Tomlinson as a delimiter between the user and host names in email addresses. However, this caused conflicts for users of the Multics operating system, as the @ sign was used to send a "line kill" command. This led to debates and fights over standardizing email protocols and setting conventions.

Despite these challenges, email continued to grow in popularity on the ARPANET. In 1973, a study commissioned by the ARPA found that three-quarters of all traffic on the network was email. It became a crucial tool for communication and collaboration among the network's users. In fact, email became so essential that ARPA director Stephen Lukasik relied heavily on it to manage the agency and communicate with his staff.

As the network grew and technology advanced, improvements were made to email systems to address the challenges of formatting, addressing, and compatibility. Programmers like Ted Myer and Austin Henderson worked on standardizing headers and creating new protocols. However, conflicts between different systems and operating systems persisted.

Despite the challenges and conflicts, email on the ARPANET became a crucial tool for communication and collaboration among researchers and scientists. It was a testament to the power and potential of network communication, and it paved the way for the email systems we use today.
