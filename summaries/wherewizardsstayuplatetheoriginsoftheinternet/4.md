In January 1969, Frank Heart's team at BBN Technologies started working on the contract to build the first Interface Message Processors (IMPs) for the ARPANET. The contract was worth over $1 million and required the team to build four IMPs, with the first one due at UCLA by Labor Day.

The team had already put in a lot of work to generate the proposal for the contract, but they were aware that there were still many unknown challenges ahead. They faced skepticism from phone company employees and academics who doubted that a packet-switching network like the ARPANET would actually work. The critics believed that integrating all the hardware and software to make the system function properly would be the real challenge. Additionally, there were concerns about the lack of profitability for companies like AT&T or IBM. It was unclear if there was a mass market for a computer network like the ARPANET, aside from government agencies and computer scientists.

One of the biggest doubts the team had before winning the bid was whether ARPA would trust such a small company like BBN Technologies with such an important project. Winning the contract put a lot of pressure on the team because if the IMPs didn't work, networking and packet-switching would be seen as failed experiments.

Despite the doubts and criticisms, Heart mostly ignored the detractors and focused on the technical challenges ahead. One of the main challenges was ensuring that data could be sent reliably over ordinary phone lines, despite the inevitable errors introduced during transmission. The IMPs would have to compensate for these errors and ensure that packets were delivered correctly.

The team also had to anticipate circuit outages, especially if the experiment expanded from four nodes to a coast-to-coast network. Bad weather or other disruptions could cause interruptions in service, and the IMPs would have to handle these situations. Additionally, the team had to solve complex routing problems to prevent messages from circulating endlessly without reaching their final destination. There were also concerns about memory buffer jams and delivering packets within the specified time frames.

Furthermore, the project schedule for the ARPANET was on a fast track, as it was tied to budget and political considerations. BBN's job was to demonstrate that the network concept could work, rather than building a perfect network. Heart knew that compromises would be necessary to meet the deadlines, but this created tension between his perfectionism and his drive to deliver on time.

BBN faced numerous challenges that had caused other bidders and potential bidders to drop out of the running. Now, all these problems were Heart's responsibility, and he would have to navigate them to successfully build the IMPs and demonstrate the feasibility of the ARPANET.

In summary, in January 1969, Frank Heart's team at BBN Technologies started working on the contract to build the first Interface Message Processors for the ARPANET. Despite skepticism and doubts from critics, the team faced numerous technical challenges, including ensuring reliable packet transmission, handling circuit outages, solving routing problems, and meeting strict time specifications. Additionally, the project schedule was on a tight deadline, which created tension between meeting deadlines and achieving perfection. Nevertheless, Heart and his team were determined to build the IMPs and demonstrate the feasibility of the ARPANET.
