The content provided describes the plan and execution of a party celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the installation of the first ARPANET node at UCLA. The ARPANET, which was the precursor to the modern internet, had grown significantly in popularity and utility since its inception. The party was organized by BBN, the company that had built and installed the original nodes.

The party was seen as an opportunity for BBN to highlight its pioneering role in the development of the internet and to boost its reputation. The company had struggled in the past decade, failing to capitalize on commercial opportunities and facing legal troubles. BBN had been accused of overcharging the government and altering time sheets to cover it up. Although the company had settled the charges and moved on, its image had suffered.

BBN's new CEO, George Conrades, saw the party as a marketing opportunity and planned for it to be big and lavish. The company rented out the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston and invited computer industry luminaries, as well as the press. Conrades wanted the party to be a celebration of the past but also a signal for the future. He had plans for BBN to expand its role in internet-related businesses.

The invitation list for the party was carefully curated, with input from key figures in the development of the ARPANET. Vice President Al Gore, an advocate for the information superhighway, was invited, as was Congressman Ed Markey, who had put the internet on his political agenda. Bill Gates was invited but declined, as did some other notable figures from the internet community.

The party itself consisted of various events, including a reception, a press conference, photo sessions, and a dinner. The ARPANET pioneers delivered speeches and shared stories from the early days of the internet. The atmosphere was one of celebration and camaraderie, with old friends reuniting and reminiscing.

The party also highlighted the issue of credit and ownership of the internet. Each of the pioneers felt a sense of pride and wanted to be recognized for their contributions. Some even jokingly vied for credit for certain inventions or aspects of the internet.

Overall, the party was considered a success and a memorable event for those who attended. It brought together key figures in the development of the internet and allowed them to reflect on their achievements and the impact of their work. It also served as a reminder of the potential for the internet to shape the future.
