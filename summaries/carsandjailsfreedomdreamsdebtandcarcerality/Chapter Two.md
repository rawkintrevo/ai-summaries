Chapter Two of the book explores the experiences of formerly incarcerated individuals in relation to cars and mobility. It begins with interviews of individuals who express their love for driving and the sense of euphoria and freedom it brings. Within prison walls, cars often become a topic of conversation and a symbol of status. Many incarcerated individuals keep car magazines in their cells and reminisce about past cars they have owned or dreamed of owning. However, cars also represent a loss of freedom for these individuals, as they are unable to drive while in prison.

Upon release, obtaining a car becomes a crucial aspect of reentry. Cars are seen as a means of reestablishing oneself and gaining independence after prison. They offer mobility, privacy, and the ability to easily access job interviews, family members, and various services. Cars provide a sense of freedom and control that was taken away during incarceration. Additionally, they allow individuals to distance themselves from their prison past and regain social respect.

However, the desire for a car is not without its challenges. Racial capitalism plays a significant role in American automobility and carcerality. The car industry and related businesses profit from the existence of racial hierarchies, which reinforces inequality. Many interviewees are aware of this and recognize the racialized economy that both restricts and profits from their desire for cars.

For formerly incarcerated individuals, cars can also be a source of anxiety and potential danger. Being pulled over by the police is a constant fear, as it can lead to unnecessary searches, arrests, and potential parole violations. Pretextual stops and racial profiling are common experiences for Black and brown drivers, leading to heightened awareness and vigilance while on the road. However, cars are still considered a necessary aspect of life after prison, despite the risks involved.

The chapter concludes by noting the importance of understanding the experiences of driving and car ownership for formerly incarcerated individuals. It highlights the intersecting issues of race, class, and the criminal justice system that shape these experiences. By examining the connection between cars, mobility, and freedom dreams, the chapter sheds light on the ongoing challenges faced by individuals reentering society after incarceration. The next chapter will delve into the impact of debt, financial hardship, and the challenges of navigating the economy and job market post-release.
