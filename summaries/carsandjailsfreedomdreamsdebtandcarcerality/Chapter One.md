In Chapter One of the book, the author explores the significance of cars in American society and how they have become a symbol of freedom and mobility. The chapter begins by discussing the debate over whether Americans' love affair with cars is coming to an end, especially in the wake of declining auto sales and the rise of car- and ridesharing services. The author notes that while the auto industry has faced challenges in the past, it always manages to bounce back. Despite changes in the economy and shifts in consumer behavior, the car remains a necessity for the majority of American households.

The chapter then delves into the history of automobility in the United States, tracing its origins to the early decades of American motoring. The author describes how the rise of car ownership was not driven by love but rather by the practicality and freedom that cars provided. For many people, especially those living in small towns and rural areas, owning a car was seen as a necessity for everyday tasks and a means of escape from limited surroundings. The author also discusses the role of advertising and marketing in promoting car ownership and how cars became a symbol of status and independence.

Moving on, the chapter explores the racial and class dynamics of automobility. The author argues that cars have played a central role in the history of racial capitalism in America. From the early years of motoring, racial minorities, especially African Americans, faced barriers to car ownership and mobility due to discriminatory practices. The chapter highlights the struggles faced by African American drivers, including the need for guidebooks like the Green Book to navigate a segregated landscape and the increased policing and discrimination they faced while on the road.

The chapter concludes by discussing the intersection of cars and the criminal justice system. It argues that cars have become a tool of control and surveillance, with police officers using traffic stops as a pretext for searching individuals and vehicles, especially racial minorities. The chapter examines the expansion of police powers over drivers and the erosion of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. It also discusses the militarization of police vehicles and the impact of this on communities.

Overall, the chapter provides a thought-provoking exploration of the role of cars in American society and the complex relationship between automobility, racial capitalism, and the criminal justice system. The author raises important questions about the impact of these dynamics on individual freedom and mobility in the United States.
