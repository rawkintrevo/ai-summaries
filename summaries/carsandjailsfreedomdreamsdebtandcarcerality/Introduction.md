This book investigates the paradox of car ownership and use in relation to the American credit economy and carceral system. The authors explore how debt and carcerality intersect in the lives of individuals, particularly those who are incarcerated or formerly incarcerated. They examine the impact of automobiles on incarceration rates, the financial burden of owning a car, the risks associated with driving while Black or brown, and the collusion between the financial system and criminal justice system. 

The book argues that the car, traditionally seen as a symbol of freedom and mobility, is actually a source of unfreedom and immobility for many individuals. It highlights how formerly incarcerated people, upon release, often need to own a car in order to meet basic needs and find employment. However, obtaining a car often means taking on high-interest auto loans, which can lead to financial hardship and even incarceration if payments are not met. Traffic stops, which are disproportionately targeting people of color, are another source of potential arrest and reincarceration. 

The authors discuss the role of the automobile in perpetuating racial inequalities and discrimination. They examine how police officers use traffic stops as a site of discretionary and racist policing, leading to the disproportionate arrest of Black and brown drivers. The book also looks at the racial disparities in auto lending, insurance, and traffic fines. It argues that the financial system and criminal justice system collude in the criminalization of poverty, particularly for low-income and BIPOC communities.

The book also explores the broader implications of car ownership and use in terms of surveillance, privacy, and environmental impact. It discusses how the collection and use of data from connected cars raises concerns about privacy violations and potential abuses by law enforcement. It also examines the environmental impact of car-centric transportation systems and the need for alternative modes of transportation.

The authors argue that systemic change is necessary to address the issues raised in the book. They call for stronger regulation of the auto loan industry, decriminalization of traffic violations, and greater investment in public transit options. They also emphasize the need for a broader reimagining of transportation systems that prioritize equity, sustainability, and social well-being.

Overall, the book provides a comprehensive analysis of the intersection of car ownership, debt, and the criminal justice system in the United States. It sheds light on the ways in which driving can be both dangerous and expensive, particularly for marginalized communities. The authors challenge the notion of the car as a symbol of freedom and mobility, arguing that it can instead perpetuate unfreedom and oppression. The book calls for a reevaluation of car-centric transportation systems and a shift towards more just and sustainable alternatives.
