In Chapter Five of the book, the experiences of formerly incarcerated individuals in the United States are explored, particularly in relation to the challenges they face with transportation and car ownership. The chapter highlights how the financial burdens of incarceration, such as fines, fees, and damaged credit, can make it difficult for individuals to afford a car or maintain ownership of one. The chapter also discusses how police contact, including traffic violations and arrests, can further compound the financial struggles faced by formerly incarcerated individuals.

The chapter begins with the story of Rhonda Jones, who, upon her release from prison, had limited financial resources and a damaged credit score. She faced difficulties reinstating her driver's license and had to rely on family members to lend her their cars. The chapter highlights the additional challenges faced by individuals who have been victims of identity theft while incarcerated, as their credit can be negatively impacted by fraudulent charges.

The chapter goes on to discuss the high costs associated with car ownership for formerly incarcerated individuals. Many individuals rely on car loans to purchase a vehicle, but their damaged credit scores result in high interest rates and monthly payments. The chapter explores how this financial burden can become overwhelming, especially when combined with other expenses such as rent and insurance. The chapter also discusses the impact of medical debt on car ownership, particularly for individuals who experience health issues upon their release from prison.

Another focus of the chapter is the role of police contact in perpetuating financial struggles for formerly incarcerated individuals. The chapter highlights stories of individuals who have been victims of corrupt police practices, such as solicitation of bribes or theft of money and drugs. The chapter also explores how traffic violations and arrests can lead to fines, fees, and additional costs, further straining individuals' finances.

Overall, the chapter emphasizes the interconnected challenges of transportation and financial stability faced by formerly incarcerated individuals. The financial burdens of fines, fees, and damaged credit, combined with the high costs of car ownership and the impact of police contact, make it difficult for individuals to rebuild their lives after incarceration. The chapter calls attention to the systemic and structural barriers that contribute to these challenges and suggests the need for policy changes to help support individuals in their reentry into society.
