The document discusses the concept of meritocracy in Asia, focusing specifically on Singapore and China. It explains how Singapore has built its economic model on the ideas that good government is essential to economic development and that "good people" are essential to good government. The country implements a system of selecting and training talented individuals to lead, starting from a young age. Students who show promise are given scholarships to study abroad and are required to work for the government for a certain number of years upon returning. Singapore benchmarks public sector jobs against private sector pay to attract ambitious individuals to public service.

The document also highlights the role of Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of Singapore, in promoting the meritocratic idea. He believed in harnessing the intellectual abilities of the few to achieve national greatness and even suggested that elite men should choose highly educated women as wives to produce smarter children. Lee took his meritocratic vision from the philosophies of Confucianism and emphasized the importance of government by "honorable men" who can earn the trust and respect of the population.

In China, there has been a shift towards meritocracy in recent years, with a focus on recruiting talented individuals for civil service positions. The government uses exams to select and promote officials and has implemented measures to prevent corruption and favoritism. However, the document notes that China's recent decision to remove term limits for President Xi Jinping, allowing him to stay in power indefinitely, raises questions about the country's commitment to political meritocracy.

The document also discusses the emphasis on education in Asia, particularly in countries like Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. These countries place high value on academic achievement and success in exams, leading to a booming tutoring and cramming industry. However, there are concerns that this focus on exams and cramming sacrifices a "real" education and puts too much pressure on students.

Overall, the document presents a nuanced view of meritocracy in Asia, highlighting both its successes and shortcomings. While Singapore has achieved economic success through its meritocratic system, there are concerns about elitism and conformity. In China, there are challenges in balancing meritocracy with corruption and a lack of political freedom. The emphasis on education in Asia has led to impressive academic achievements but also raised concerns about the pressure placed on students. Nonetheless, Asia's focus on meritocracy and education suggests that the region is shaping the future of meritocracy.
