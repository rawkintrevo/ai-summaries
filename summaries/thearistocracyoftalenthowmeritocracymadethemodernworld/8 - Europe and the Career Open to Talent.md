The French Revolution brought the concept of meritocracy into European politics. Article VI of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen stated that all citizens are "equally admissible to all public offices, positions, and employments, according to their capacity, and without any other distinction than that of virtues and talents." This idea challenged the old society's principles of the feudal and dynastic systems. The revolutionaries aimed to create a society where individuals could compete for positions based on their talents and virtues, rather than their class or status.

The concept of meritocracy had echoes of the Chinese idea of selecting potential elites from the population and the Platonic idea that guardians can be found in every class. However, the French Revolution took it a step further by suggesting that all citizens are equal before the state and can push themselves forward as potential decision-makers. The revolutionaries abolished the feudal principle that defined the relationship between masters and dependents based on land tenure, as well as the dynastic principle that put families at the heart of power. They believed that individuals should compete for political positions based on their talents and virtues, rather than relying on the state to micromanage.

The Enlightenment philosophers played a significant role in shaping the idea of meritocracy. They argued that the old order of society was incompatible with reason, progress, and human nature. They emphasized the distinction between the natural aristocracy of talent and the artificial aristocracy of breeding. Some philosophes believed that natural aristocrats were a product of their environments, while others believed that they were born with innate abilities.

The Enlightenment's belief in the natural aristocracy of talent aligned with the growing demands for a meritocratic society. This belief also led to the celebration of geniuses as the engines of human progress. Philosophes argued that geniuses possessed talents that could not be solely attributed to training or experience. They were regarded as the highest examples of humanity and were seen as replacements for the royalty of the old society.

The Enlightenment's focus on human nature and the contradiction of the absolutist state were two significant factors that influenced the French Revolution. The philosophes argued that society should be ruled by ability rather than lineage, and the state collapsed when it was given a push because of its logical contradictions.

In addition to the French Revolution's influence, the Enlightenment also influenced Germany. The defeat of Prussia by Napoleon led to the realization that the old class structure no longer matched society's productive infrastructure. As a result, Prussia embarked on educational reforms to embrace the forces of the revolution and remain competitive. Germans believed in the importance of "Bildung," the broad sense of self-cultivation, and the idea that individuals could rise through the ranks based on merit and talent.

Overall, the French Revolution injected the concept of meritocracy into European politics, challenging the old societal structures and advocating for positions and opportunities based on an individual's talents and virtues. This idea shaped the educational systems and the role of the individual in society in France and Germany. The Enlightenment philosophers played a significant role in shaping these ideas, emphasizing the importance of human nature, the distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy, and the celebration of geniuses as the engines of progress.
