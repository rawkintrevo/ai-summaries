In this chapter, the author discusses the rise of meritocracy in the West, specifically in Europe. They argue that the West embraced meritocracy, along with science, capitalism, and individualism, while China's mandarin regime was too rigid to combine government by a cognitive elite with economic dynamism.

The author first examines the concept of sponsored social mobility, which involves identifying talented individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and providing them opportunities to enter the elite. This practice began as an ad hoc solution in feudal societies, where feudal lords would identify talented servants and give them a leg up. However, it later became a regulated mechanism, where sponsors would identify talented children, provide them with a privileged education, and then offer them positions in the elite.

One avenue of social mobility in the early Middle Ages was through the aristocratic household. Noble lords would employ supervisors and stewards to manage their estates, and over time, these supervisors would become honorary members of the ruling elite. The royal household also played a significant role in social mobility, as the expansion of the household's responsibilities required intelligent bureaucrats, professional soldiers, and local functionaries.

The Church was another avenue for upward mobility in medieval society. The Church preached both obedience to authority and revolution. Jesus taught the equality of souls under God and emphasized the moral equality of individuals. The Church also challenged hierarchical bonds and family ties, advocating for the respect and inclusion of the poor and downtrodden. As the Church's ruling caste of celibate intellectuals needed to be replenished, recruitment from outside the Church was necessary.

The Church's embrace of education allowed for the institutionalization of sponsored social mobility in schools and universities. England's public schools, such as Winchester College and Eton College, were founded to provide free education to talented but impoverished boys. Similarly, universities across Europe developed sliding fee systems to accommodate poorer scholars, providing exemptions for fees based on family circumstances or social connections.

The growth of the state in the Early Modern period further expanded sponsored social mobility. Demand for capable bureaucrats outpaced the supply from the landed aristocracy, leading to the emergence of talented individuals from non-aristocratic backgrounds in positions of power, such as Thomas Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell in England.

The author then delves into the revival of the polis, or city-state, which introduced self-government as a new principle in Europe. Venice, in particular, became a powerful city-state and a maritime trading empire. The city emphasized a regulated mechanism of government, checking the power of the doge and incorporating new individuals into decision-making.

Other Italian city-states asserted their right to self-rule, creating powerful city councils and limiting the power of bishops and nobles. These city-states formed alliances, such as the Lombard League, to preserve their collective independence. Northern European cities also negotiated favorable charters with kings, establishing corporate rights, citizenship based on civic rights, and empowering city councils to govern.

The author then discusses performance-related aristocracy, which originated in classical Greek and Roman ideals. The Renaissance saw a resurgence of these ideals, emphasizing personal merit, education, and virtue as the basis of true nobility. This led to a restructuring of elite education, focusing on classical civilization and training in the liberal arts to develop moral qualities needed for governance.

The Protestant Reformation further disrupted traditional social hierarchies and emphasized individual responsibility and hard work. The Protestant emphasis on education and the study of the Bible led to the establishment of elite Protestant institutions, such as universities and schools, as well as the promotion of hard work.

Europe's system of sponsored social mobility and its embrace of meritocracy, individualism, and education allowed for the growth of a dynamic society that outpaced China. Europe's belief in the equality of individuals and their ability to make their own destinies contributed to the rise of meritocracy in the West.
