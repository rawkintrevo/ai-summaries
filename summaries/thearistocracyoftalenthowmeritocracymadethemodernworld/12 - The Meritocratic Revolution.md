The meritocratic revolution, which gained momentum after World War II, transformed various aspects of society in Britain, America, and France. The expansion of the welfare state and the shift to a knowledge-based economy increased opportunities for ordinary people and emphasized the importance of education and intellect. In Britain, the demands of total war forced the military and factories to promote individuals based on talent rather than social class. The 1944 Education Act in the UK and the GI Bill in the US provided greater access to education for a wider range of individuals. Grammar schools in Britain and research universities in America became vehicles for social mobility, admitting students based on merit rather than social status. The creation of the ENA in France gave similar opportunities to talented individuals by providing them with rigorous exams and training.

The success of bright grammar school students in Britain challenged the dominance of public school students in Oxbridge and led to a decline in the elite’s representation in higher education. The rise of the working-class in academia and politics, such as Harold Wilson and Edward Heath, revolutionized the Labour and Conservative Parties. These developments, however, generated debates about the impact of social mobility, with some arguing that the breakdown of class solidarity caused isolation among scholarship winners. Still, the expansion of educational opportunities marked a significant departure from the past and opened doors for many individuals.

In America, the rise of the meritocracy in academia was exemplified by Clark Kerr, who championed the idea of the multiversity and the importance of research-based meritocracy. The University of California, under Kerr’s leadership, focused on producing accomplished technocrats and professionals. Business schools also played a role in nurturing the meritocratic spirit, training individuals in the principles of business and management. The arrival of the "whizz-kids" after World War II, such as Robert McNamara and Tex Thornton, who brought financial and managerial controls to ailing companies like Ford, signaled a change in the relationship between business and trained intelligence. Business schools and consulting firms like McKinsey and BCG, which produced intellectual models and theories, became important in shaping the business world.

The meritocratic revolution faced criticism, with some arguing that it perpetuated elitism and eroded solidarity among working-class communities. Concerns were also raised about the potential dehumanization of individuals and the stress and competition that the meritocracy brought. However, the revolution opened up new opportunities for women, who were often excluded from elite education and professional positions. The meritocracy challenged traditional gender roles and paved the way for more female empowerment.

Overall, the meritocratic revolution transformed society by breaking down barriers and providing greater opportunities for individuals to succeed based on their talent and ability. Education became a key driver of social mobility, research institutions emerged as hubs of intellectual discourse, and business embraced the value of trained intelligence. While the revolution had its critics, it laid the groundwork for a more inclusive and fair society.
