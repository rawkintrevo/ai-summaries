In "Plato and the Philosopher Kings," the author discusses Plato's vision of a society governed by an intellectual elite and stratified by education, as laid out in his work, "The Republic." The author notes that this vision has been both admired and criticized by subsequent thinkers throughout history. Plato's Republic is described as an aristocracy based on equality of opportunity rather than inherited wealth and position. Plato believed that individuals were naturally divided into three types based on their natural abilities: gold, silver, and bronze. Gold individuals, who had the ability to think deeply and rule justly, were considered the rightful guardians of the Republic.

Equality of opportunity meant that individuals were assigned roles based on their innate abilities, not their parents' ambitions. Plato argued that society must be readjusted in each generation to ensure this. He believed that children should be assigned to roles suited to their natural abilities rather than their parents' desires. Plato also argued that women should be included as potential guardians, as he believed that differences between individuals were more important than differences between the sexes.

Plato's Republic also included communal child-rearing, in which children were taken from their parents at birth and raised by the community. This served several purposes: it freed women from childcare responsibilities, ensured equal opportunities for all children regardless of their parents' wealth, and prevented family bonds from undermining the interests of the Republic as a whole.

Plato outlined an extensive training program for these guardians, focusing on both moral and intellectual education. The goal was to produce philosopher kings, or intellectual aristocrats, who could lead the Republic towards justice. Plato believed that a just society was one in which everyone was in their proper place, ruled over by philosopher kings who knew the difference between truth and lies and beauty and ugliness.

The author notes that Plato's vision of a society ruled by philosopher kings has influenced thinkers throughout history. Educators have tried to create ruling classes that embody Plato's ideals, and political leaders have sought to govern as philosopher kings. The author also discusses how the influence of Plato's ideas has waned in recent times, as public schools have focused more on science than the classics and political leaders prioritize self-interest over public duty.

Despite the criticism leveled against Plato's vision, the author argues that it remains relevant today. Plato's identification of the tension between looking after one's own children and providing equality of opportunity is still a pressing issue in meritocratic societies. Additionally, Plato's critiques of populism and the rise of psychologically challenged tyrants resonate in the modern world. The author concludes by noting that while the Western world may have moved away from Plato's ideas, the East, particularly China and Singapore, continues to draw upon a tradition that values wise rulers and governance.
