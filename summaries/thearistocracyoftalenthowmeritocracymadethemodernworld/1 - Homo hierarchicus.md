The document discusses the concept of hierarchy in pre-modern societies, particularly in Europe. In these societies, people were born into fixed places in society, and the social order was seen as a reflection of the divine order. The document explores the theory of inequality and how it was reinforced by legal rights and obligations. Nobles, for example, had special privileges and exemptions, while commoners had certain obligations and limited rights.

The hierarchy of status was also tied to the idea of honor, which determined how people were treated and how they treated others. Honor was closely linked to social position and was a demanding taskmaster. The document also discusses how corporate bodies, such as aristocratic assemblies and professional guilds, enjoyed special privileges and rights based on their membership. This complex system of privileges and rights made pre-modern societies difficult to define and understand.

The document goes on to explain how this hierarchical view of society was challenged in Europe during the Tudor and Stuart periods. The rise of a new commercial society and the influence of Renaissance humanism began to question the old assumptions of hierarchical society. The document explores how the defenders of the old order had to justify themselves in the face of these challenges.

The document then delves into how the hierarchy of society worked in practice, particularly in terms of land ownership and the power of the aristocracy. In pre-modern societies, the most powerful people were those who owned land, and the aristocracy invested in turning themselves into warriors. Over time, as the concept of warfare evolved, aristocrats spent more time cultivating their estates and politicking at court.

The document also examines how the principles of hierarchy governed every social relation, from masters ruling over serfs to husbands ruling over wives and children. Society celebrated hierarchy through rituals and small gestures, such as doffing hats in deference to those of higher social status. The social order was based on entitlement, with certain people entitled to certain treatment based on who they were rather than what they had achieved.

Additionally, the document discusses the importance of tradition and lineage in pre-modern societies. The aristocratic family was seen as the basic unit of society and was defined by its relationship to place and time. Rights, status, laws, and property were justified by inheritance and tradition rather than reason or utility. The document also explores the disdain for labor and the importance of conspicuous leisure and consumption in aristocratic society.

The document concludes by highlighting how education and ambition were seen as threats to the hierarchical order. Education was seen as dangerous, filling minds with nonsense and weakening bodies. Ambition was seen as a vice that led to individual depravity and social unrest.

Overall, the document provides an in-depth analysis of the concept of hierarchy in pre-modern societies, particularly in Europe. It explores the theories of inequality, the reinforcement of status through legal rights and obligations, and the importance of honor and tradition. The document also discusses the challenges to this hierarchical order and the ways in which it worked in practice.
