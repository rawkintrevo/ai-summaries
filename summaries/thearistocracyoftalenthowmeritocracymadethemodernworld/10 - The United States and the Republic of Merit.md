In this excerpt, the author explores the concept of meritocracy in America. The author argues that the American Revolution brought about a revolution in the minds and hearts of the people, leading to the rejection of the old doctrine of social hierarchy and the embrace of a society based on individual merit. The idea of meritocracy did not extend to everyone equally, as many Americans clung to vestiges of the old order and inequality still existed, particularly for African-Americans. However, the author contends that enough people embraced the principles of meritocracy to turn America into a different kind of place from Europe.

The author attributes America's belief in self-invention and self-reliance to its status as a nation of immigrants and its vast size, which allowed for greater mobility. The American spirit of leveling the playing field and embracing self-made individuals can be seen in the rejection of deference, the prominence of the Protestant work ethic and faith in self-reliance, and the absence of attachment to place.

The author also discusses the influence of Puritanism and the Enlightenment on the development of a meritocratic society in America. Americans exemplified the Protestant work ethic and the Protestant faith in self-reliance, which distinguished them from Europeans who showed more deference to authority. The American Revolution reinforced this meritocratic mindset, both in the fighting itself and in the subsequent constitution-making process. New Hampshire's constitution, for example, declared that no government office or position should be hereditary, reflecting the rejection of inherited privilege.

The idea of a natural aristocracy emerged during this time, with figures like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams grappling with the concept. Jefferson argued that there was a natural aristocracy among men based on virtue and talents, and that society should be structured to allow these individuals to rise to positions of leadership. Adams, on the other hand, expressed more ambivalence towards the concept, recognizing the importance of talent but also warning of the dangers of an aristocracy becoming a ruling class. Hamilton, a self-made man himself, championed the idea of meritocracy and believed that economic success was the best measure of individual merit.

The meritocratic ideals of the Founding Fathers were tested in the 19th century as America experienced significant economic and social changes. The rise of the robber barons and the consolidation of wealth created challenges to equality of opportunity and dispersed power. However, the author notes that these challenges also led to the creation of reforms, such as the establishment of the Civil Service Commission, to reduce corruption and increase meritocracy in government. The development of elite schools and universities, the self-improvement movement among African-Americans, and the efforts of political reformers were all examples of attempts to extend the ladder of opportunity and promote meritocracy.

In the second half of the 19th century, America saw the rise of a new elite class and the concentration of vast fortunes at the top of society. This challenged the ideals of meritocracy and led to efforts to address inequality and concentration of power. The author argues that America's suspicion of centralized power and its belief in bottom-up meritocracy helped to counteract these challenges.

Overall, the excerpt presents the development of meritocracy in America as a complex and evolving concept. While the ideals of meritocracy were not always fully realized and faced challenges from corruption and inequality, the author argues that the belief in individual merit and the ability to rise through one's own talents remained a defining characteristic of American society.
