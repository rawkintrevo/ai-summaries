The revolt against the elite, driven by opposition to meritocracy, has reshaped global politics. Examples include the Brexit vote in the UK, the election of Donald Trump in the US, nationalist victories in Hungary and Poland, and the rise of populist parties in Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. These revolts are part of a larger revolt of the masses against the meritocratic elite and their privileging of intellectual achievement over tangible skills and traditional values. Economic, cultural, and regional divisions also play a role in driving the populist movements.

One key divide is the diploma divide, where those with lower levels of education are more likely to support populist movements. In the UK, 72% of people with no educational qualifications voted to leave the EU, compared to 35% of those with a university degree. In the US, Donald Trump won whites without college degrees by a large margin. The revolt against the cognitive elite is also a clash between London and the provinces, as London is seen as a hub of the financial and cultural elite. The populist right positions themselves as representing the people against the educated elite, while the old right positioned themselves as defending the existing order against socialist subversion.

The populist revolt is driven by a sense of marginalization and resentment towards the elite. The elites have taken control of institutions and created a diploma democracy, excluding those without degrees from positions of power. There is also a sense of condescension from the elite towards the working class, with many elites expressing contempt for those outside their social circle. The populist revolt is further fueled by instances of self-dealing and corruption among the elite, such as the financial crisis and the expenses scandal in the UK. These factors contribute to a sense of unfairness and disillusionment among the masses.

The populist revolt has also centered around national identity, with nationalists prioritizing the interests and culture of the nation over global forces. The meritocratic elite are often seen as cosmopolitan and detached from national concerns. Expertise is also a flashpoint, with populists often questioning the authority of experts and emphasizing the importance of common sense and intuition.

The rise of populism has also led to a radicalization of the left, with the emergence of new radical movements such as Black Lives Matter. These movements reject the idea of a color-blind society and view meritocracy as a tool of white power. They argue that supposedly objective standards are distorted by power and that black people are forced to conform to a curriculum and standards designed by and for white people.

Overall, the revolt against the meritocratic elite is driven by a sense of marginalization, resentment, and disillusionment among the masses. Populist movements are challenging the authority and privileging of the intellectual elite, as well as questioning the fairness of the current system. The future of populism remains uncertain, but the divisions and grievances that have fueled these movements are likely to persist.
