The article discusses the concept of meritocracy and its historical development in Britain. It begins by examining the roots of meritocracy in the Puritan Revolution and the appointment of individuals based on their promise and ability in the Commonwealth. The author then discusses the rise of the intellectual aristocracy in the 18th and 19th centuries, driven by the Industrial Revolution and the philosophy of British liberalism. The Utilitarians and economists promoted the idea that individuals should be rewarded based on their merit and abilities rather than their inherited status. The author argues that this led to a shift in societal values and the recognition that talent and accomplishment should be the basis for social advancement.

The article goes on to discuss the challenges faced by the intellectual aristocracy and how they sought to reform society. The abolition of slavery and the promotion of free trade were major achievements of this period. The author highlights the importance of the meritocratic idea in the field of education, with the introduction of written examinations and competitive admission to universities. The Cambridge University examinations, in particular, became renowned for their rigor and the opportunities they provided for social mobility. The author emphasizes the role of education in promoting meritocracy and the belief that talent should be nurtured and rewarded rather than limited by social status.

The article then explores the tension between meritocracy and democracy, with some liberals arguing that the masses were not capable of making informed decisions and that a meritocratic elite should govern society. However, the author acknowledges the importance of democracy and the need to include all members of society in the decision-making process. The author also discusses the role of socialism in promoting meritocracy, with thinkers like the Webbs and George Bernard Shaw advocating for a system that rewards ability and promotes social mobility. The author argues that socialism offered a solution to the problem of inequality and the inefficient allocation of resources in capitalist societies.

The article concludes by discussing the implementation of meritocracy in Britain, particularly in the field of education. The government established scholarships and examinations to identify and nurture talented individuals, regardless of their social background. The author highlights the success stories of self-educated individuals who rose to prominence through their own efforts. The article argues that meritocracy played a crucial role in shaping British society and promoting social mobility, creating opportunities for talented individuals to succeed and contribute to the nation's progress.
