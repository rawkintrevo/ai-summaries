Cost-reimbursement contracts are a type of government contract where the government reimburses the contractor for the reasonable, allocable, and allowable costs incurred in performing the contract. These contracts are typically used for projects where it is difficult to estimate the costs upfront, such as research and development work.

Before issuing a cost-reimbursement contract, the government must determine if the contractor's accounting system has the ability to accumulate costs by contract. Direct costs are costs specifically identified with a particular contract, while indirect costs are expenses incurred by the contractor that cannot be attributed to a specific contract. Indirect costs are further classified as either overhead expenses or general and administrative expenses.

The total cost of a cost-reimbursement contract is established through a negotiation process between the government and the contractor. The contractor agrees to put forth its best effort to complete the job within the agreed-upon cost estimate. The contracting officer closely monitors the contractor's performance to ensure effective and efficient contract execution.

If the contractor's actual costs exceed the estimated cost, the contract is modified to reflect the revised estimate. If the contractor completes the job for less than the estimated cost, the excess funds can be used for other projects. The contractor's bill under a cost-reimbursement contract is called a public voucher.

There are different types of cost-reimbursement contracts, including cost contracts, cost-sharing contracts, cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts, and cost-plus-award-fee contracts.

- A cost contract is a cost-reimbursement contract where the government reimburses the contractor for all allowable costs incurred during performance, and the contractor receives no profit.
- A cost-sharing contract is a cost-reimbursement contract where the government reimburses the contractor for a predetermined portion of the allowable costs, and the contractor absorbs the remaining portion in expectation of compensating benefits.
- A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is the most commonly used cost-reimbursement contract. The government pays all allowable costs and a fixed fee to the contractor, regardless of the actual costs incurred.
- A cost-plus-incentive-fee contract allows for an initially negotiated fee that is adjusted based on the relationship between total allowable costs and total target costs. This contract type provides incentives for the contractor to achieve cost savings.
- A cost-plus-award-fee contract provides for a base fee at inception and an award amount based on the contractor's performance against specific criteria. The award fee is determined by the contracting officer's evaluation of the contractor's performance.

Cost-reimbursement contracts are regarded as the government's least favorite contracting method because they place most of the cost risk on the government. The government must closely monitor the contractor's performance to ensure effective and efficient contract execution.

Contractors must adhere to regulations regarding cost reasonableness, allocability, and allowability in order to be reimbursed for their costs. Reasonable costs are those that a prudent person in a competitive business would incur, while allocable costs are those that can be specifically identified with a particular contract. Allowable costs must be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and conform to specific limitations or exclusions set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Overall, cost-reimbursement contracts provide a way for the government to allocate the risks and costs associated with certain projects while incentivizing contractors to efficiently manage their costs and deliver quality work.
