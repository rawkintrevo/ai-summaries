Marketing to the federal government can be a complex and challenging task. The government spends over $500 billion annually on contracts, but understanding how to navigate the procurement process and stand out from the competition is crucial. This chapter provides valuable tips and insights on how to effectively market your supplies and services to the federal government.

One important factor to consider when marketing to the government is that federal buying offices must allow full and open competition for their purchases. This means that contractors can compete for federal contracts without having to belong to an exclusive country club. The government prioritizes accountability and transparency in how taxpayer dollars are spent, so understanding the government's procurement methods and available support services is key.

Finding markets for your supplies and services is the first step in marketing to the federal government. Contrary to popular belief, you do not have to be located near Washington, D.C. or a federal agency itself to compete for contracts. The government has over 2,500 buying offices and countless federal facilities located throughout the country, so there may be opportunities right in your backyard. It is important to research and identify which markets offer the greatest opportunities for success based on your available resources, location, business type, and experience.

The internet is a powerful tool for finding federal agencies and marketing opportunities. Each federal agency has its own website, typically ending in .gov, where you can find information about their procurement processes and contract opportunities. FedBizOpps (FBO) is the official government website where federal procurements over $25,000 are posted. It allows contractors to search, monitor, and retrieve opportunities solicited by the entire federal contracting community. FedBizOpps lists synopses and notices of proposed contract actions, contract solicitations, amendments, subcontracting leads, and contract awards. It is recommended to regularly check FedBizOpps for new opportunities and to subscribe to their Vendor Notification Service to receive procurement announcements by email.

Furthermore, getting on a Federal Supply Schedule, also known as GSA Schedule, is highly advantageous for commercial contractors looking to sell to the federal government. GSA Schedules allow contractors to establish long-term government-wide contracts for their specific products and services. This prequalifies your company to contract with federal agencies and provides them with a list of preferred vendors. GSA Schedules make it easier for government agencies to quickly close federal sales while staying within procurement rules for competition.

Additionally, it is important to stay informed about the government's priorities and program changes. The Federal Register is the daily newspaper used by the federal government to announce changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Paying attention to the Federal Register can help you anticipate the government's future opportunities and needs. Federal agency acquisition forecasts are another valuable source of information. Each federal agency is required to compile and make available one-year projections of contracting opportunities that small and small disadvantaged businesses can perform. These forecasts can be found online, and they offer insights into future procurement actions and potential teaming prospects.

Other resources to consider when marketing to the federal government include SBA's TECH-Net database, which features a search engine for high-tech small businesses, and the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), which collects and disseminates data on the government's spending on supplies and services. FPDS provides visibility into procurement and acquisition activities within federal agencies, and it can help contractors identify market changes, analyze procurement history, and pinpoint where to concentrate their sales efforts.

Lastly, it is important to be aware of year-end procurements. The federal government operates on a fiscal year from October 1st to September 30th, and agencies must spend their funds during that fiscal year or lose the funding. This often results in a surge of procurement activity in the fourth quarter, making it a critical time for contractors to be proactive and take advantage of potential opportunities.

In conclusion, successfully marketing to the federal government requires a comprehensive understanding of the government's procurement methods, finding the right markets, leveraging online resources, and staying informed about the government's priorities and program changes. By following these tips and strategies, contractors can increase their chances of securing federal contracts and tapping into the government's $500 billion annual spending.
