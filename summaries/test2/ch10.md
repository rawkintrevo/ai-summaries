Simplified acquisition procedures are used by the federal government for small purchases or commercial items. These procedures are designed to reduce administrative costs and simplify the purchasing process. The simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) is set at $150,000, meaning that any acquisition under this amount can use simplified acquisition procedures. These procedures make up 90 percent of the government's purchase transactions, but account for less than 20 percent of the total procurement dollars.

Micropurchases are purchases that are $3,000 or less, or $2,000 in the case of construction. These purchases cover routine supplies and services and account for 70 percent of the government's purchasing actions. Micropurchases do not need to follow the same requirements as larger purchases, such as competitive quotes or the Buy American Act. They can be made from any type of seller, not just small businesses. Micropurchases are often made using government-wide commercial purchase cards, which allow for quick and easy transactions.

Simplified acquisition methods are used for purchases between $3,001 and $150,000. These methods include oral solicitations, which are encouraged when it helps expedite the purchase. Request for quotation (RFQ) is another method, where the government solicits prices for purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold. The government-wide commercial purchase card can also be used for purchases under $3,000. Another method is the use of blanket purchase agreements (BPAs), which are essentially charge accounts set up with qualified vendors. BPAs give buying offices more flexibility and choice when making purchase decisions. Finally, there is the fast payment procedure, which allows the contractor to be paid before the government verifies that the supplies have been received and accepted. This improves the contractor's cash flow.

Overall, simplified acquisition procedures are designed to simplify and expedite the purchasing process for small purchases or commercial items. These procedures save time and resources for both the government and contractors, and provide opportunities for small businesses to participate in government contracting. It is important for businesses to be familiar with these procedures so that they can navigate the policies and requirements when selling supplies or services to the government.
