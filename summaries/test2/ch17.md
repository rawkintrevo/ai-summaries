The chapter on Contract Administration provides detailed information on the responsibilities and processes associated with managing a federal government contract.

The chapter begins by highlighting the administrative responsibilities that contractors must be prepared to handle after the contract is awarded. This includes complying with labor laws, preparing budgets and status reports, performing inspections, and preparing invoices.

The chapter then discusses the roles of the government and the contractor in contract administration. The government acts through its agent, the administrative contracting officer (ACO), who performs or oversees contract-related functions. The ACO's level of involvement depends on the type and nature of the contract.

Next, the chapter discusses contract financing, which is available to contractors in certain circumstances. The government uses three methods to finance a contract: progress payments, guaranteed loans, and advance payments. Progress payments are typically used for construction contracts and are based on the costs incurred by the contractor during contract performance. Guaranteed loans are similar to conventional loans, but the government shares in any losses. Advance payments are made before the work is complete, and the contractor must provide adequate security.

The chapter also covers the process of getting paid, including preparing and submitting proper invoices. Contractors must include specific information on their invoices, such as the contractor's name and address, invoice date, contract number, and price of supplies delivered or services performed.

The chapter then discusses the changes clause, which allows the contracting officer to make unilateral changes to a contract in areas such as specifications, method of work performance, government-furnished facilities, equipment, materials, services, or site, and the performance schedule.

Contract modifications, which are written changes to an existing contract, are also covered in the chapter. Contract modifications can be made by unilateral action of the contracting officer or by bilateral action of the contracting parties. Different procedures apply depending on the type of modification.

The chapter also covers constructive changes, which are actions or failures to act by the government that cause the contractor to perform additional or different responsibilities from those expressed in the contract. Contractors must notify the contracting officer in writing when a government action affects the contract terms and conditions.

Other topics addressed in the chapter include government-furnished property, inspection and acceptance requirements, contractor data rights, record retention, audits and examination of records, the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, alternative dispute resolution, termination for convenience, termination for default, and contract closeout.

Overall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the administrative responsibilities and processes associated with managing a federal government contract. It emphasizes the importance of complying with contractual requirements, preparing and submitting proper documentation, and resolving disputes in a timely and efficient manner.
