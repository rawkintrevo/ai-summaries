Negotiated procurements are the federal government’s most flexible acquisition method. These procedures allow for bargaining and discussions with potential contractors before making a final source selection. Negotiated procurement procedures take many forms and can involve competitive proposals, restricted competition, or even sole source contracts. They are ideal for research and development projects as each contractor may take a different approach to meet the government’s needs.

The solicitation document most often used under negotiated procurement procedures is the request for proposal (RFP). The RFP contains all the information needed for prospective contractors to prepare their proposals. It is important for contractors to read the RFP carefully and decide if they want to invest the time and effort in preparing a proposal.

During the evaluation process, the government evaluates both technical and price proposals. Technical proposals are evaluated based on factors such as the soundness of the proposed technical approach, the innovativeness of the approach, and compliance with the requirements. Price proposals are evaluated based on factors such as completeness, reasonableness, and realism. The source selection authority then makes a decision based on the evaluation of all the proposals.

The source selection process can use various techniques such as the best value continuum, trade-off process, or lowest price, technically acceptable process. The best value continuum looks for the best overall value to the government, taking into account factors such as technical requirements and price. The trade-off process allows the source selection authority to select the offer that provides the best value, even if it is not the lowest-priced offer. The lowest price, technically acceptable process selects the proposal that meets the requirements at the lowest evaluated price.

Once the contract is awarded, unsuccessful offerors can request a debriefing to understand why their proposal was not chosen. Debriefings provide information on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal and the rationale for the award decision. Successful offerors can also request a debriefing to learn how they can improve their proposal in the future.

If a contractor disagrees with the award decision, they can file a protest. Protests are written objections to the solicitation, proposed award, or award of a contract. They must be filed within ten days of the basis for the protest being known. Protests can be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or directly with the contracting officer or the buying agency. GAO adjudicates the decision and provides a report to the protester and the contracting officer. If a protester disagrees with the GAO’s decision, they can appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Overall, negotiated procurements allow for flexibility and discussions between the government and potential contractors. They provide an opportunity for the government to evaluate technical superiority and choose the best value for their needs. However, they can be a time-consuming process and require careful preparation of proposals. If a contractor is not chosen for the award, they have the option to request a debriefing and file a protest if they disagree with the decision.
