Subcontracting opportunities are a way for businesses to enter the federal contracting market. These opportunities allow new vendors to partner with existing contractors and learn the ropes of dealing with the federal government. Subcontracting involves a company entering into a contract to perform work for a customer and then hiring another firm to provide a portion of the goods or services necessary to fulfill the contract. The company that enters into the contract is known as the prime contractor, while the company that is hired is the subcontractor.

Subcontracting can be a lucrative option for small businesses, as the market for subcontract work is nearly as large as the basic government market for contracting. In fact, in FY 2010, the Department of Defense (DoD) prime contractors awarded over $139.5 billion in subcontracts, with more than 36 percent of those contracts going to small businesses. Additionally, subcontracting allows small businesses to take advantage of contracts that are only available through prime contractors.

Prime contractors often subcontract certain portions of their work to small businesses in order to be eligible for a government contract. The Small Business Administration (SBA) requires large businesses receiving contracts over a certain value to develop plans and goals for awarding subcontracts to qualified small businesses. These plans must include the total dollars planned to be subcontracted, as well as percentage goals for awarding subcontracts to small businesses. The prime contractor is responsible for designating a small business liaison to work with subcontractors.

When selecting a subcontractor, prime contractors consider factors such as the degree to which the company's products or services fit the requirements of the contract, the size and socioeconomic status of the firm, and the technical superiority of the goods or services. It is important for the subcontractor to understand that the contract clauses in the prime contractor's agreement with the government will flow down to them, meaning they are equally bound to comply with the applicable acquisition rules and regulations.

Subcontracting agreements can be negotiated and signed at any point during the solicitation process, but it is generally advantageous for the prime contractor to have the agreement signed prior to awarding the contract. This allows the prime contractor to calculate the total amount of risk it is taking on and lock in the subcontractor's terms and pricing. It is important for subcontractors to review the agreement and address any areas of concern before signing, as it is better to resolve any issues beforehand rather than dealing with disputes once the work has begun.

The Department of Defense's Mentor-Protégé Program provides incentives to major contractors to help small disadvantaged businesses and organizations enhance their capabilities for performing DoD contracts. Through this program, mentors share their management expertise and technical skills with the protégé to enhance their competitiveness in the government contracting market. This program can be beneficial for both mentors and protégés, as mentors can strengthen and expand their own capabilities, while protégés gain valuable guidance and support.

Overall, subcontracting can be a valuable opportunity for small businesses to enter the federal contracting market and gain valuable experience. By partnering with existing prime contractors, small businesses can build relationships and learn the ins and outs of government contracting. Subcontracting allows small businesses to tap into a large market, gain access to contracts only available through prime contractors, and receive support and guidance through mentor-protégé programs.
