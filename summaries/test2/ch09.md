The federal marketplace offers numerous resources to help small businesses participate in federal contracting. These resources include programs and services provided by the Small Business Administration (SBA), Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC), the Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Small Business Programs, the General Services Administration (GSA), USA.gov, and the National Contract Management Association (NCMA).

The SBA offers a wide variety of programs and services to small businesses, including business development assistance, procurement assistance, minority small business assistance, advocacy, and financial assistance. The SBA also provides counseling services to business owners on all aspects of small business matters.

The SBA answer desk is a toll-free information center that provides information on starting or running a business and getting assistance. The Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) provides one-on-one management counseling to aspiring entrepreneurs and business owners. The SBA also operates Small Business Development Centers (SBDC), which provide management assistance to small business owners. SBDC services include assisting small businesses with financial, marketing, production, organization, engineering, and technical problems.
