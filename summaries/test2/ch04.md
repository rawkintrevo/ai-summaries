This chapter discusses the opportunities for small businesses and independent contractors in the federal marketplace. It begins by highlighting the importance of small businesses in the US economy, stating that they create new jobs, contribute to innovation, account for a significant amount of output and sales, and employ a large portion of the private workforce.

The Small Business Act of 1953 is then explained, which requires the government to award a “fair proportion” of its federal contracts to small businesses and provide them with maximum opportunity to participate in federal contracting. To ensure these requirements are met, the Small Business Administration (SBA) was established.

Government-wide goals for awarding federal contracts to small businesses are then discussed. These goals are typically stated as percentages of the procurement dollars spent by the government each year. In 2012, the government-wide goals were set at 23% for all small businesses, 5% for small disadvantaged businesses, 5% for small women-owned businesses, 3% for small HUBZone businesses, and 3% for small service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is introduced as the system used to identify different types of industries and establishments. It replaces the outdated U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system and focuses on how products and services are created, rather than what is produced.

Small business size standards are explained, which are set by the SBA on an industry-by-industry basis and are used to determine eligibility for federal programs and services. The size standards are generally based on the average number of employees for businesses that deal with products, and average annual sales for businesses in the service industry. The SBA provides a table of size standards based on NAICS codes to help businesses determine if they qualify as small.

The chapter then discusses the process of size certification, where most contractors self-certify their status as a small business. However, the contracting officer may request a formal size determination from the SBA or the decision may be compelled by a competitor’s protest. The consequences of intentionally misrepresenting the company’s size are also highlighted.

The concept of small business affiliates is explained, which includes entities that have the power to control each other or are controlled by a third party. Affiliation influences the determination of a company’s size, as businesses must combine their incomes and employees for sizing purposes.

The Certificate of Competency (COC) program is introduced, which helps small businesses obtain federal contracts for which they were determined to be the lowest responsive and responsible bidder when the award decision was based on price alone. Small businesses can apply to the SBA for a COC if the contracting officer questions their ability to perform the contract.

The chapter concludes by discussing small business set-asides, which ensure that a fair proportion of the government’s procurements go to small and small disadvantaged business concerns. All simplified acquisitions, other than micropurchases, are set aside for small business by law. The “rule of two” is explained, which states that purchases exceeding $150,000 must be set aside exclusively for small business participation if there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two responsible small businesses at fair market prices. The concept of partial set-asides and class set-asides is also discussed.
