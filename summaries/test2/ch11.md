Sealed bidding is a procurement process used by the government to purchase noncommercial products or services that are estimated to exceed $150,000. It is designed to protect the integrity of the competitive bidding system and ensure that qualified contractors have the opportunity to compete for government contracts without any favoritism. Sealed bidding can only be used when certain conditions are met, such as clear and accurate government specifications, expected competition from two or more bidders, adequate time for the bidding process, and an award based on price and other price-related factors.

The solicitation process for sealed bidding begins with a contracting officer publicizing a synopsis for a solicitation package called an Invitation for Bid (IFB). The synopsis describes the scope of work for the project and is issued at least 15 days before the actual solicitation. The IFB contains all the information that bidders need to know to fulfill the contract and is divided into sections and subsections. It includes a description of supplies or services, specifications or statement of work, technical data, packaging requirements, inspection and acceptance criteria, delivery or performance schedules, and the deadline for submission of bids. The contracting officer typically allows at least 30 days between the issuance of the IFB and the bid opening.

There are four different formats that can be used in preparing an IFB: award/contract format, combined synopsis/solicitation, uniform contract format, and simplified contract format. The format used depends on the type of contract being awarded.

When preparing a bid, bidders must carefully review the IFB's specifications, instructions, and clauses. It is important to obtain and read all the necessary documents before bidding and seek clarification from the contracting officer if there are any questions. Bidders must meet the requirements of all the documents cited in the solicitation package. Bidders should not substitute items or make assumptions without authorized clarification.

Once the bid has been prepared, it must be submitted before the deadline specified in the IFB. Late bids are generally not accepted unless certain exceptions apply, such as mishandling by the government, specific mailing requirements, or being the only offer received.

All bids in response to an IFB are secured until the bid opening, which takes place in a public location at the specified time. Anyone can attend a bid opening, and the bid opening officer publicly opens and records all the bids. The contracting officer evaluates the bids based on price, options, economic price adjustments, transportation costs, and other factors. The lowest responsive and responsible bidder is awarded the contract, and unsuccessful bidders are notified in writing.

Sealed bidding allows for a faster evaluation and award process at the lowest price. However, it is less likely to be used for state-of-the-art products and services compared to negotiated procurement, which allows for trade-off analysis to determine best value. Some contracting activities never issue IFBs.

In summary, sealed bidding is a rigid procurement process used by the government for purchasing noncommercial products or services exceeding $150,000. It ensures fair competition among qualified contractors and requires compliance with all specifications and requirements outlined in the IFB. The process includes the solicitation of bids, bid opening, bid evaluation, and contract award to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder.
