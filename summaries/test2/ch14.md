Fixed-price contracts are agreements between the government and a contractor where the government agrees to pay a specific price for completed work and delivered products. The price is not subject to adjustment based on the contractor's cost experience. The contractor bears the cost risk but also has the opportunity to earn maximum profit by managing the contract effectively.

There are several types of fixed-price contracts, including firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts, fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment, fixed-price incentive contracts, fixed-price contracts with prospective price redetermination, and fixed-ceiling-price contracts with retroactive price redetermination.

FFP contracts are used when the statement of work can be clearly described and a fair and reasonable contract price can be established. The contractor accepts full cost responsibility, and if costs exceed the target cost, the contractor still needs to fulfill the contract requirements at their own expense.

Fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment are used when there is price uncertainty, such as fluctuations in the cost of materials. The contract price is revised based on established prices, actual costs of labor or material, or cost indexes of labor or material. There is a ceiling on upward adjustments but no floor for downward adjustments.

Fixed-price incentive contracts include incentives that can increase or decrease a contractor's profit based on performance. These contracts are used when there is cost uncertainty but not enough to warrant a cost-reimbursement contract. The final contract price is calculated based on the relationship between total actual cost and target cost, with a sharing formula determining the contractor's profit or loss.

Fixed-price contracts with prospective price redetermination provide for a firm fixed price for an initial period and a redetermination of the contract price at a stated date during performance. This type of contract is used when negotiations have determined that an FFP or FPI contract is not appropriate.

Fixed-ceiling-price contracts with retroactive price redetermination allow for a price redetermination after the contract is completed. These contracts are used for research and development contracts with estimated costs of $150
