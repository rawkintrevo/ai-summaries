The chapter discusses the Federal Supply Schedule program, which is a procurement method used by the government to purchase commercial items. This program offers over 30 million commercial products and services from over 21,000 suppliers and accounts for close to $40 billion in federal purchases each year. 

The Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), a division of the General Services Administration (GSA), is responsible for managing and operating the Federal Supply Schedule program. FAS negotiates contracts with commercial firms to provide products and services at set prices for specific periods. These contracts are known as schedule contracts and are approved by FAS.

There are different types of schedule contracts, with the most common being the multiple award schedule (MAS). MAS contracts are awarded to multiple vendors for the same types of products and services. Federal agencies can purchase from the list of vendors on the MAS, and contractors must provide prices that are at least as good as the prices offered to commercial clients.

To become an approved supplier under a GSA schedule, a business must go through an application process. This includes reviewing the GSA schedule solicitation, obtaining a Dun & Bradstreet reference check, and completing the solicitation. Once approved, the business is assigned a GSA contract number and placed on a list of approved suppliers.

It is important for businesses to market their schedule contract to potential customers. This can be done by developing a contract price list and distributing it to potential customers. Advertising in MarkeTips, a publication for GSA customers, can also be a useful marketing tool. Additionally, businesses should consider posting their price list or company catalog on GSA Advantage, an online ordering system for government buyers.

The chapter also discusses government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs), which are prenegotiated contracts for IT products and services. GWACs are more limited in scope and are generally more competitive to obtain compared to GSA schedules.

The chapter concludes by discussing the challenges faced by small businesses that sell products and services to the government through federal supply schedules. These challenges include low markups and the lack of incentive for large businesses to use regular dealers. Despite these challenges, the chapter emphasizes the importance of having a GSA schedule and effectively marketing to government buyers in order to be successful in the federal contracting market.
