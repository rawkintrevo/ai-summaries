This chapter provides an overview of the rules and regulations that businesses must follow when contracting with the federal government. It begins by discussing the constitutional authority that allows the federal government to enter into contracts with private citizens and commercial organizations. The chapter explains that for a contract to become the legal obligation of the federal government, it must be based on statutory authority.

Congressional responsibilities are also discussed, with the chapter explaining that Congress is responsible for drafting and passing the laws and statutes that establish the various federal agencies and specific programs proposed by those agencies. The chapter notes that there are over 4,000 laws currently in effect that regulate federal contracting, with numerous bills pending in Congress that could affect how the government exercises its contracting functions.

The chapter goes on to discuss Central Contractor Registration (CCR), which is now known as the System for Award Management (SAM). It explains that businesses must register with SAM before they can be awarded a federal contract, and that they must update or renew their information at least once a year to maintain an active status.

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is described as the "bible" for businesses contracting with the federal government. The chapter explains that the FAR contains the uniform policies and procedures for all procurements of products and services, and that each executive branch agency is required to adhere to the FAR rules when making purchases with congressionally appropriated funds.

The chapter also covers the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994, which was enacted to simplify and streamline the federal acquisition process. It explains that FASA requires federal agencies to maximize the use of commercial buying practices and to accept the terms and conditions offered by the private sector unless they can negotiate better terms and conditions.

Other acts and regulations discussed in the chapter include the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, the Buy American Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Service Contract Act of 1965, and the Freedom of Information Act. The chapter provides brief explanations of each of these acts and regulations and their implications for businesses contracting with the federal government.

Overall, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the rules and regulations that businesses must navigate when contracting with the federal government. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and complying with these regulations in order to succeed in the government marketplace.
