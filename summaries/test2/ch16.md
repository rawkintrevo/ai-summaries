In this chapter, the different types of contracts are discussed. These contracts are used by the government to provide flexibility in various contracting situations. Some of the contract types highlighted in the chapter are indefinite-delivery contracts, time-and-material contracts, labor-hour contracts, letter contracts, basic ordering agreements, performance-based contracting, multiyear contracts, options, and life-cycle costing.

Indefinite-delivery contracts are used when the government can accurately specify what it intends to purchase but cannot define the exact delivery dates and/or quantity required. One of the advantages of this contract type is that it allows contractors to maintain a limited stock of the supplies being purchased and permits direct shipment to federal agencies.

Requirements contracts are a type of indefinite-delivery contract used when the government anticipates recurring requirements but cannot specify the precise quantities needed during the contract period. The contracting officer determines an estimate of the total quantity required based on previous requirements and consumption. However, this estimate does not guarantee that the contractor will receive any orders.

Indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contracts provide for an indefinite quantity of supplies or services to be furnished during a fixed period. These contracts are encouraged by the government as a way to deal with understaffing and expedite purchasing. ID/IQ contracts can be made for up to a five-year period and orders can run for up to five years. There are rules in place to ensure fair competition for most orders.

Time-and-materials contracts are typically used for specialized or high-tech services where estimating the costs or extent of the work is difficult at the time of contract award. The contractor provides direct labor at fixed hourly rates and materials at cost. T&M contracts are closely monitored by the government due to the incentive they provide for contractors to increase costs to increase profit.

Labor-hour contracts are a variation of the T&M contract where the contractor does not supply materials.

Letter contracts are used in national emergencies to provide immediate relief. They are written preliminary contractual instruments that authorize a contractor to begin manufacturing products or performing services immediately. The letter contract should be as complete and definite as possible and should include a negotiation schedule for definitization.

Basic ordering agreements (BOAs) are not contracts but are written instruments of understanding negotiated between the government and a contractor. They allow the government to expedite the procurement of products or services when specific items, quantities, and prices are unknown at the time of the agreement. BOAs are typically used when there is a need for a contractor's particular products or services during the forthcoming year.

Performance-based contracting methods base the total amount paid to a contractor on the level of performance quality achieved and contract standards met. The aim is to motivate the contractor to perform at its best. Performance-based contracts should describe the work in terms of required output and use measurable performance standards and procedures for reductions in fee or price for non-performance.

Multiyear contracts are for the purchase of products and services for more than one year but not more than five years. Multiyear contracts are encouraged to achieve lower costs, continuity of production, stabilization of the contractor workforce, and a broader competitive base. Agencies proposing to use multiyear contracts must seek advance approval during the budget process.

Options give the government the unilateral right to purchase additional products or services called for by the contract. The presence of an option does not guarantee that the government will exercise it. Options are considered based on price and other factors.

Life-cycle costing (LCC) is the estimation and analysis of the total cost of acquiring, developing, operating, supporting, and disposing of an item or system being acquired. LCC enhances decision-making and is used as a management tool throughout the acquisition process. The government is concerned about LCC because operating and support costs can be greater than acquisition costs. Various methods and models are used to calculate LCC.

In conclusion, these contract types provide the government with flexibility in various contracting situations. The choice of contract type should be based on an objective analysis of all factors involved and the contract type that fits the procu
