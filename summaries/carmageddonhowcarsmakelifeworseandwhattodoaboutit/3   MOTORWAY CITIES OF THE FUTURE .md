The article explores the history of urban planning and transportation in Britain, with a focus on the rise of the automobile and its impact on cities. The author starts by discussing J.B. Priestley's observations of Coventry in the 1930s, where he noted the city's transformation from a picturesque medieval town to a bustling center of automobile and cycle manufacturing. The author traces the roots of the automobile industry in Coventry to the bicycle industry and the invention of the modern-style safety bicycle in the 19th century.

The city's automobile industry thrived during the First and Second World Wars, with Coventry becoming a target for German bombs due to its crucial role in aircraft engine production. The destruction caused by the Coventry Blitz in 1940 provided an opportunity for the city to be rebuilt with the car in mind. Architect Donald Gibson led the planning and development of a new city center, which prioritized roads and parking spaces for cars. The post-war government supported this car-centric approach to urban planning, and similar developments were carried out in cities across Britain.

The article highlights the role of influential figures such as Lewis Mumford and Donald Gibson in promoting the car as a symbol of progress and development. However, the negative consequences of this approach to transportation planning soon became apparent. The "predict and provide" model, which aimed to build enough infrastructure to accommodate increasing car ownership, led to the decline of public transportation, including trams and railways. The removal of trams and branch railways left many communities isolated and reliant on cars. In addition, the prioritization of cars in urban planning resulted in the loss of public space and the domination of roads and parking lots.

The author also explores the impact of car-centric planning on social inequality. The rise of car ownership favored the affluent and marginalizes the poor, who often rely on public transportation. The article argues that the car-centric approach to transportation planning has contributed to wealth concentration and resource depletion, particularly in relation to oil consumption. Furthermore, the decline of public transportation has led to limited mobility for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and disabled.

The article concludes by discussing the ongoing challenges and consequences of car-centric urban planning. Despite efforts to promote alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling and public transit, cars remain the dominant form of transportation in Britain. The author argues that sustainable solutions are needed to address the negative effects of car-centric planning, including congestion, pollution, and social inequality.
