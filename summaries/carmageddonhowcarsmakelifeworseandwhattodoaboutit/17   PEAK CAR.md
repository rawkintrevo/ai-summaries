In this excerpt, the author discusses their personal experience of learning to drive and why they ultimately chose not to continue pursuing a driver's license. They reflect on the decline in driving among young people in both the United States and the United Kingdom and note various reasons for this trend, including the rising cost of driving, changes in cultural attitudes towards car ownership, and the resurgence of cities as desirable places to live. However, the author also points out that the number of cars on the road continues to increase, largely due to older generations driving more.

The author argues that there is an opportunity to provide more people with the chance to live in walkable cities and rely on alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport, bicycles, and walking. They highlight the lack of suitable housing in walkable neighborhoods and the need for more construction in these areas to accommodate the growing demand. The author also emphasizes the importance of investing in public transport infrastructure that better serves the needs of families and women, who often have different travel patterns and preferences.

The author acknowledges that owning a car can have certain conveniences but states that many people, including themselves, would prefer not to rely on cars for daily transportation. They highlight the benefits of alternatives, such as public transport, in terms of reduced stress, cost savings, and environmental sustainability. The author suggests that the car industry and public policy often prioritize car ownership and neglect the preferences and needs of those who would rather go without a car.

The author concludes by emphasizing the potential for a shift towards a world where cars are less necessary and less dominant. They argue that achieving this shift will require making people feel safer, improving infrastructure, and shifting mentalities about transportation options. The author believes that a world with fewer cars on the road and more emphasis on walkable cities is possible and desirable.
