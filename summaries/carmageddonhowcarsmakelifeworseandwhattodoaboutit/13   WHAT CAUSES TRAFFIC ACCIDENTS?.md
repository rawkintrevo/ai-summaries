The article discusses the high rate of traffic deaths worldwide, with a focus on the United States. The author shares personal experiences of driving in different countries, highlighting the dangerous driving conditions in many developing countries. The author emphasizes that poor infrastructure is a leading cause of traffic deaths, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

The article presents statistics on traffic deaths, stating that 1.35 million people worldwide are killed each year in car crashes, with motorcyclists, cyclists, and pedestrians being the majority of victims. Lower- and middle-income countries account for 90 percent of car crash deaths, despite having a smaller share of the world's vehicles.

The author compares the historical trends of traffic deaths in different countries. In the past, the United States had a high rate of traffic deaths, but other countries such as the UK, France, and the Netherlands have significantly reduced their number of deaths through improved road safety measures. The author argues that the United States has not made the same progress in reducing traffic deaths, with the country's traffic death rate being much higher than in Europe.

The article examines the causes of car accidents, with 94 to 96 percent of accidents being attributed to human error. Factors such as speeding, aggressive overtaking, drunk driving, distracted driving, and driving sleep-deprived contribute to accidents. The author highlights the cultural factors that contribute to dangerous driving in the United States, such as tailgating, veering across lanes, and reckless behavior.

The article criticizes the road design and infrastructure in the United States, which it claims encourages dangerous driving. Wide highways in urban areas, lack of roundabouts, intersections instead of roundabouts, and a lack of sidewalks in many American suburbs are cited as examples of dangerous road design. The author argues that wider roads and straighter streets lead to faster driving speeds, which increases the likelihood of fatal accidents.

The article discusses the role of car manufacturers and the car industry in promoting dangerous driving. The author argues that the car industry's focus on speed and comfort overlooks the importance of safe driving. The article also criticizes the car industry's efforts to introduce technology to make driving faster, such as autopilot systems and in-car entertainment systems that can distract drivers.

The article suggests that governments and highway engineers prioritize drivers' convenience over road safety, due to drivers' preferences for fast and comfortable driving. The author argues that this mindset needs to change and that road safety should be prioritized over driving ease. The article highlights successful road safety initiatives in cities like New York City and Boston, where measures such as speed cameras and road redesigns have led to significant reductions in traffic deaths.

Overall, the article argues that road design, infrastructure, and cultural factors contribute to high rates of traffic deaths worldwide, with a particular focus on the situation in the United States. The author calls for a shift in priorities towards road safety and the creation of an environment where safe driving is emphasized and encouraged.
