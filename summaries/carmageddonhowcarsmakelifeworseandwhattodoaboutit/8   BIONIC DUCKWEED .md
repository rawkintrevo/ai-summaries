The article discusses the concept of "bionic duckweed," which refers to technologies that may never materialize but are used as excuses to avoid making costly investments in existing infrastructure. The author uses the example of a hypothetical miracle pill that could cure all illnesses, leading to a decline in investment in healthcare infrastructure. They argue that relying on such unproven technologies can be risky, as it may lead to a lack of preparedness if the technology does not materialize.

The author then uses the example of self-driving cars as another form of bionic duckweed. While there has been significant hype around autonomous vehicles, the technology is far from being fully developed and safe. The author highlights the challenges in programming self-driving cars to make split-second decisions in complex and unpredictable situations. They argue that self-driving cars may never work well in congested, urban environments and that they will likely lead to increased traffic rather than solving congestion issues.

Furthermore, the author criticizes Elon Musk's idea of building a network of underground tunnels for individual cars. They argue that this approach is inefficient and would not solve traffic problems. The author suggests that investing in public transportation systems, such as trains, would be a more effective solution to reduce congestion and improve mobility.

Finally, the article raises concerns about the cost and feasibility of Musk's tunneling projects. While his company, The Boring Company, has built a functional tunnel in Las Vegas, it is limited in capacity and reliant on individual cars. The author questions the practicality of using tunnels for individual cars instead of higher-capacity vehicles like trams.

In conclusion, the article highlights the risks and limitations of relying on unproven technologies, such as self-driving cars and underground tunnels for individual cars. The author argues for investing in proven and efficient solutions, such as public transportation, to address traffic congestion and improve mobility.
