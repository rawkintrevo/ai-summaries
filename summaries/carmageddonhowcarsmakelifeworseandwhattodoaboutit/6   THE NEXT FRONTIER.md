The article explores the issue of car ownership and its impact on cities in the developing world, using Mumbai as a case study. It highlights the challenges and consequences of rapid car ownership growth in cities with limited infrastructure and high population densities.

The author begins by stating that many developing world cities are currently going through what cities like New York, Chicago, and London experienced a century ago when mass car ownership was a new phenomenon. The article focuses on Mumbai, India's financial capital, as an example of a densely populated city grappling with the consequences of increasing car ownership.

The author describes the chaotic nature of driving in Mumbai, with constant traffic consisting of various modes of transportation, from cars and buses to rickshaws, motorcyclists, cyclists, and pedestrians. The lack of reliable traffic lights and the presence of potholes and flood-prone streets further contribute to the challenging driving conditions. The author also notes the stark inequality in car ownership, with wealthier individuals having their own cars and drivers, while the majority of the population relies on overcrowded trains and buses.

The article highlights the rapid growth in car ownership in Mumbai over the years, with the number of registered cars increasing from 320,000 in 1981 to over three million in 2018. However, the road infrastructure has not kept pace with this growth, leading to severe congestion and limited space for cars. The author mentions the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, a toll road constructed to alleviate traffic congestion, but notes that it has only funneled more cars into the already crowded city.

The consequences of congestion are evident, with high levels of air pollution and a negative impact on the quality of life for residents. The author argues that investments in improving public transportation, such as buses and metros, would be more beneficial in reducing congestion and improving accessibility, especially for low-income residents who cannot afford cars.

The article also addresses the issue of car ownership in other developing world cities, such as Nairobi, where similar challenges and consequences are observed. The author emphasizes the need for a shift in mindset, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive urban planning that prioritizes public transportation over private cars. However, the author acknowledges the complex political and economic factors that often hinder such shifts in developing world cities.

In conclusion, the article highlights the pressing need for cities in the developing world to address the challenges and consequences of increasing car ownership. It calls for investments in sustainable and inclusive urban infrastructure, focusing on public transportation rather than prioritizing private cars. The article emphasizes that the example set by developed countries, where car ownership has contributed to congestion and environmental issues, should not be replicated in the developing world. Instead, innovative and context-specific solutions should be sought to ensure livable and sustainable cities for all residents.
