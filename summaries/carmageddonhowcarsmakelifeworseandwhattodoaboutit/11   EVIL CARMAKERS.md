The article explores the Volkswagen emissions scandal in detail, highlighting the ethical and environmental issues surrounding the company's actions. It explains that Volkswagen, founded by Hitler and associated with slave labor during World War II, commissioned research in 2015 to demonstrate that its cars produced clean air. The research involved exposing monkeys to exhaust fumes and was funded by a lobby organization supported by German car manufacturers. The experiments were kept secret and were part of a propaganda campaign to show that Volkswagen's cars were environmentally friendly.

The article then delves into the background of diesel engines and their environmental impact. Diesel engines were initially marketed as a more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline engines. However, diesel engines produce higher levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are harmful to human health and contribute to air pollution. The article explains that scientists were attempting to show that nitrogen oxides were not dangerous to monkeys, thus challenging the World Health Organization's classification of diesel exhaust fumes as a carcinogen.

The article also details the cheating tactics employed by Volkswagen to deceive emissions tests. Volkswagen installed "defeat devices" on their cars, which detected when the car was being tested on rollers and activated the pollution control system. However, when the car was driven on the road, the pollution control system was disabled to improve the car's efficiency and performance. This allowed Volkswagen to pass emissions tests while emitting high levels of pollutants in real-world conditions.

The consequences of the Volkswagen emissions scandal are explored, including the billions of dollars in fines and the negative impact on the company's reputation. The article discusses the broader issue of cheating and unethical behavior within the car industry, drawing comparisons to the leaded gasoline scandal of the past.

The article also highlights the role of government and regulatory bodies in allowing and even encouraging deceptive practices by car manufacturers. It argues that the competitive nature of the industry creates incentives for companies to prioritize profits over ethical considerations. The article concludes by suggesting that the car industry has received relatively positive public perception compared to other industries, despite its history of unethical practices.

Overall, the article provides a comprehensive account of the Volkswagen emissions scandal and raises important questions about the broader issues within the car industry. It sheds light on the ethical and environmental implications of the industry's actions and challenges the notion that car manufacturers should be trusted to prioritize public health and environmental concerns.
