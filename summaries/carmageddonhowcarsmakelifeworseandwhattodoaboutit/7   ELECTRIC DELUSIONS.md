The city of Kolwezi in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a key site for the production of copper and cobalt, which are crucial components in the lithium batteries used in electric cars. Congo accounts for around three-quarters of the world's cobalt supply, making it the largest supplier of the metal. However, while the demand for cobalt has tripled in the past decade due to the rise of electric cars, the wealth from the mining industry has not trickled down to ordinary Congolese people. The country suffers from corruption and mismanagement of its natural resources, leading to widespread poverty and inequality.

The mining industry in Congo is divided into two types: industrial mining and artisanal mining. Industrial mining is carried out by large international firms that acquire licenses from the Congolese government and employ predominantly expatriate workers. Artisanal mining, on the other hand, is done by small-scale miners who extract minerals by hand. Artisanal mining accounts for about 15-20% of cobalt production but employs around two million people, making it a significant source of income for many Congolese.

However, artisanal miners face numerous challenges such as dangerous working conditions, lack of compensation for accidents or injuries, and exposure to toxic substances. Studies have shown that children growing up in areas with artisanal cobalt mining have high levels of heavy metals in their bodies, putting them at risk of health problems. Moreover, the cobalt mining industry is controlled by Chinese middlemen who sell the ore to smelters in China, leaving very little profit for the local miners.

The electric car boom has brought some attention to the conditions in Congo's mining industry, but it has not prompted meaningful change. The focus has been on sourcing cobalt from more ethical and sustainable sources, as well as reducing the reliance on cobalt in battery production. However, these efforts have been limited in their effectiveness. While some manufacturers, like Tesla, have promised to engineer out cobalt from their batteries, it has proven challenging to do so without compromising battery performance and safety standards.

The transition to electric cars also brings additional challenges. It requires a significant increase in electricity production to meet the demand for charging. Currently, most countries still rely on fossil fuels for electricity generation, meaning electric cars are not entirely "zero-emission" in their lifetime. Moreover, the production and disposal of electric car batteries have their own environmental implications.

In addition to the environmental and social challenges, the idea that technology will solve the problems of mass car ownership without reducing car usage is flawed. The vision of a future where every individual has a self-driving electric car undermines the need for public transportation and active modes of transport like walking and cycling. It perpetuates a car-centric society and fails to address the root issues of urban planning and transportation systems.

To truly address the environmental and social impacts of the automotive industry, a holistic approach is needed. This includes investing in sustainable public transportation, promoting active modes of transport, and reimagining urban spaces to prioritize people over cars. The emphasis should be on reducing car dependency rather than simply replacing internal combustion engines with electric motors. Without such fundamental changes, the problems associated with mass car ownership will persist, even with the increased adoption of electric cars.
