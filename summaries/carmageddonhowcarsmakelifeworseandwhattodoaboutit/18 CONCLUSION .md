In early 2020, when the author began writing their book, the car industry was suffering due to the coronavirus pandemic. Many people were at home, jobless, and unwilling to spend money on cars that would sit idle in their driveways. However, there was a silver lining to the collapse of driving - the streets were clear and wildlife returned to deserted town centers. The author found solace in cycling around London without the fear of traffic congestion. 

But as the author finishes writing the book more than two years later, the global economy is booming and traffic has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Demand for cars is high, even causing a shortage of computer chips, and the car industry is thriving. Gasoline prices are at their highest in over a decade, causing concerns about CO2 emissions and energy crunches. Governments are desperate for new sources of oil and natural gas. 

The author emphasizes that now is the time to discuss the future of cars. They argue that we are at an inflection point where we can choose to unwind the dominance of cars in our society and prioritize sustainable alternatives. They propose a future where people can get around without owning a car and without emitting large amounts of CO2. They acknowledge that there will always be some journeys that are better made by car, but argue for better alternatives and a reduction in car reliance. 

The author believes that big, densely populated cities are the best places for people to live, as they offer high quality of life and sustainable lifestyles. However, they acknowledge that many people still prefer the suburban lifestyle and emphasize the need for options and affordability in cities. They argue that the sustainable option should not be more expensive than the car-dependent option. 

To achieve a shift away from cars, the author suggests implementing measures such as taxing heavy cars more, setting aside more road space for cyclists, and imposing congestion charges. They highlight the importance of political courage and ignoring the loudest voices in favor of those who want safer and more sustainable transportation options. 

The author is hopeful that the shift away from cars is beginning, with cities in America and Europe taking steps to reduce parking minimums and promote alternative forms of transportation. However, they caution that governments must be careful with new technologies and avoid embracing solutions that only benefit the elite and worsen resource consumption. 

In conclusion, the author believes that reducing the number of cars on the road is not only about climate change and urban mobility, but also about justice. They argue that cars are engines of inequality and that we do not have the resources for everyone to own a car. The author calls for a conscious effort to undo the dominance of cars and create a future with better alternatives for transportation. They believe that as a species, we are capable of living better lives without cars and that the time for change is now.
