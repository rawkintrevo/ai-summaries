The article discusses the negative impact of car culture on cities around the world, using Houston as a prime example. The city's sprawling layout, reliance on cars, and lack of public transportation have resulted in traffic congestion, air pollution, and increased carbon emissions. The article highlights Houston's vulnerability to flooding due to its flat topography, paving over of green spaces, and poor drainage system. The car-centric design of the city has made it difficult to implement public transport and walkable infrastructure.

The article argues that the car industry is supported and encouraged by governments through policies such as cheap gasoline and direct subsidies. The car industry is seen as vital to economic growth and employment stability, despite its negative impacts on the environment and public health. Additionally, the article emphasizes that the car industry benefits from hidden subsidies in the form of city designs that prioritize cars over other forms of transportation.

The article explains the challenges of building public transportation systems in car-dominated cities. The model of railway suburbs, where land was acquired before development to ensure accessibility to public transport, is no longer feasible. The car's prevalence in cities makes it difficult to shift to public transportation-oriented infrastructure. The car industry and wealthy car owners often lobby against policies that promote public transport and pedestrian-friendly cities.

The article argues that public transportation offers many benefits such as reduced congestion, lower carbon emissions, and increased land value. It suggests that cities need to prioritize and invest in public transportation systems to create more walkable and sustainable urban environments. However, the article acknowledges the difficulty in implementing changes due to the existing car-focused infrastructure and the resistance from car owners and car-dependent industries. 

The article concludes by stating that the car culture is expanding globally, particularly in developing countries, and that without addressing this issue, the impact of climate change will continue to worsen. It emphasizes the need for collective action to build cities that prioritize public transportation and walkability over car dependency.

Overall, the article highlights the negative consequences of car culture on cities and advocates for a shift towards more sustainable and walkable urban environments. It emphasizes the importance of government policies, investment in public transportation, and the need to challenge the dominance of the car industry.
