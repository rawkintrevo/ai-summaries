In the 1960s, urban planner Robert Moses had plans to build an elevated expressway, known as the Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX), across Manhattan. The plan involved demolishing hundreds of buildings and displacing thousands of families. However, Moses faced opposition from activist Jane Jacobs and her Greenwich Village neighborhood. Jacobs fought against the LOMEX project and advocated for more people-centric urban planning.

Jacobs, originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania, moved to New York City and fell in love with its vibrant neighborhoods. She began writing about the city, highlighting the unique qualities of neighborhoods like Greenwich Village. In her book, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," published in 1961, Jacobs argued against the prevailing urban planning strategies of the time, which prioritized the needs of cars over people.

Jacobs believed that cities should be designed for people, not cars. She criticized the "urban renewal" efforts that were destroying neighborhoods and displacing communities in the name of progress. Instead, she advocated for preserving the existing fabric of urban neighborhoods, emphasizing the importance of mixed-used development, pedestrian-friendly streets, and vibrant public spaces.

The fight against LOMEX was not only about preserving neighborhoods but also challenging the dominant paradigm of car-centric urban planning. Jacobs argued that building more highways and expressways would only lead to more congestion, as it would encourage more people to drive instead of using public transportation or walking. She championed the idea of density and proximity, arguing that lively, mixed-use neighborhoods with a variety of amenities and services were essential for creating vibrant and sustainable cities.

Jacobs' activism and advocacy had a significant impact on urban planning and development. Thanks to her efforts and the collective opposition to LOMEX, the project was ultimately canceled in 1969, marking a turning point in the fight against car-centric urban planning.

However, it is essential to acknowledge the criticisms of Jacobs' legacy. Some argue that her activism inadvertently contributed to gentrification, as neighborhoods like Greenwich Village became increasingly desirable and expensive. Others argue that her focus on preserving existing neighborhoods failed to address the need for affordable housing and equitable development.

Nevertheless, Jacobs' message remains relevant today. Cities around the world are grappling with issues of congestion, air pollution, and the need for more sustainable and inclusive urban environments. Jacobs' emphasis on community engagement, pedestrian-friendly streets, and mixed-use development continues to shape modern urban planning and design.

In conclusion, Jane Jacobs' fight against the LOMEX expressway and her advocacy for people-centric urban planning had a significant impact on the way cities are planned and developed. Her ideas and activism challenged the prevailing paradigm of car-centric urban planning and highlighted the importance of preserving neighborhoods and creating vibrant and sustainable urban environments. While her legacy is not without criticism, her message remains relevant in the ongoing efforts to create livable and equitable cities for all.
