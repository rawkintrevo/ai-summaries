In this excerpt, the author reflects on the negative impact of cars and car culture on cities and communities, using Chicago as an example. The author describes the congestion and traffic on the Kennedy and Eisenhower Expressways, and the scars that these roads have left on the city. They discuss the decline of the West Town neighborhood due to the construction of freeways, which displaced families and led to abandoned buildings and fires. Gentrification eventually led to the revitalization of the neighborhood, but other areas of the city have not been as fortunate, particularly on the South and West Sides, which have seen a steady decline in population.

The author argues that the construction of roads was meant to make transportation easier, but instead, it created barriers within cities and led to increased car usage and sprawl. They assert that roads are not the solution to congestion, as evidenced by the fact that traffic in Chicago is just as bad as it was before the roads were built. The author claims that cars impose costs on society, such as pollution, traffic accidents, and negative health impacts. They highlight the need to prioritize alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, in order to mitigate these negative effects.

The author also examines the global impact of cars and car culture. They provide examples from cities like Nairobi, where traffic congestion and pollution are major issues despite the low car ownership rate. The author argues that the proliferation of cars is a global problem, with the number of cars and transport emissions increasing worldwide. They criticize the car industry for promoting electric and self-driving cars as solutions, arguing that they still impose environmental and societal costs. The author also criticizes ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft for increasing traffic congestion.

The author contends that cities should prioritize the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over cars, and cites examples from Tokyo, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen where this approach has been successful. They argue that cars make people miserable and create urban environments that are less livable. The author suggests that by reducing car usage and reclaiming space for pedestrians and cyclists, cities can become more sustainable, equitable, and enjoyable places to live.

Overall, the author presents a critical view of cars and car culture, and offers a vision for a future where cities prioritize alternatives to car travel. They argue that by reducing car usage and reclaiming space for pedestrians and cyclists, cities can become more sustainable, equitable, and enjoyable places to live.
