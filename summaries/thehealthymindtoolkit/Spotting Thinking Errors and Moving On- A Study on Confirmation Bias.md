This chapter discusses various biases that can lead to poor decision-making and distress. The first bias discussed is confirmation bias, which is the tendency for our brains to favor evidence that supports our preexisting beliefs and ignore or minimize contradictory evidence. This bias can affect our judgments and decisions in many areas of life, such as home buying, product development, medical diagnoses, scientific theories, and parenting opinions. To overcome confirmation bias, it is important to actively seek out evidence that opposes our views and be open to changing our thinking when new evidence emerges.

Another bias discussed is negativity bias, which is the tendency to pay more attention to negative information and experiences compared to positive ones. This bias can be particularly pronounced in today's digital age, where negative information is often more readily available and shared. To counteract this bias, it is recommended to use objective data and base rates to make decisions, seek out positive stories to balance out negative information, consider the context and relevance of negative reviews, and question the motivations of gossipers.

The chapter also addresses the bias of overconfidence, where individuals tend to believe they are less vulnerable to cognitive biases and behavioral missteps compared to others. This bias can lead to unrealistic expectations and poor decision-making. To mitigate overconfidence, it is important to recognize that we are likely to be as susceptible to biases as others and to adopt a self-compassionate approach when realizing our flaws.

Additionally, the chapter provides suggestions for not ignoring potentially serious health-related symptoms. It discusses the tendency to minimize potential dangers or catastrophize, the tendency to delay seeking help due to lack of time or fear of interfering with one's current situation, and the tendency for worry to prevent concrete planning. To address these tendencies, it is recommended to be aware of what is normal for one's body, set aside time for personal appointments, keep track of symptom dates, have a specific list of symptoms that warrant medical attention, use an accountability partner, imagine how one would want others to handle the same symptoms, and seek preventative care appointments.

In summary, this chapter explores biases that can impact decision-making and the life directions individuals take. By being aware of these biases and actively working to counteract them, individuals can make more informed choices and prevent unnecessary distress.
