The content provided consists of information about Alice Boyes, her background, her book "The Anxiety Toolkit," and some observations about the relationship between emotions and thinking/behavior. Alice Boyes is a psychologist who graduated with a PhD in psychology in 2007. Her doctoral research, which focused on relationships, was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. After completing her studies, Boyes worked as a clinical psychologist in New Zealand from 2008 until 2013. During this time, she also wrote for magazines and maintained a blog.

Boyes retired from clinical practice and transitioned to writing. Her first book, "The Anxiety Toolkit," was published in 2015. She has also written blog posts for Psychology Today that have gained significant attention, with over 10 million views. Additionally, Boyes became a mother in 2016.

The first observation in the content provided highlights the trade-offs between emotions and thinking/behavior. It suggests that different emotions can improve certain types of thinking while impairing others. For example, during a panic attack, it would not be advisable to drive due to the potential impairment of rational thinking. Similarly, in arguments between romantic partners, emotional flooding can lead to irrational thinking and actions. In these cases, stepping back and cooling off is recommended to promote more rational thinking and behavior.

Boyes clarifies that she does not intend to dismiss those with clinical problems who require help managing overwhelming negative emotions or people with a predisposition to such difficulties. She acknowledges that practical constraints, such as financial limitations, can prevent individuals from seeking treatment. However, she notes that sometimes people overestimate the level of action that is required to address their emotions. Boyes specifically mentions anxiety as a negative emotion that can often be turned around quickly, even if it has become significant. She references a study by Kashdan et al. which suggests that one-hour exposure treatment sessions can have a positive impact on anxiety.

Boyes also mentions that psychological treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy or acceptance and commitment therapy can be beneficial for those who seek help. She notes that the benefits of these treatments typically begin to emerge within the first month.

In conclusion, the content provided offers information about Alice Boyes and her background in psychology. It discusses the trade-offs between emotions and thinking/behavior and the importance of managing emotions, especially in situations where rational thinking is necessary. Additionally, it addresses the challenges individuals face in seeking treatment for clinical problems and highlights the potential effectiveness of psychological treatments in managing negative emotions.
