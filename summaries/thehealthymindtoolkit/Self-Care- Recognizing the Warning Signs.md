In this chapter, the focus is on the importance of adding more pleasure and self-care to one's life in order to lift mood and increase resilience to stress. The author emphasizes that simple solutions to simple problems can be effective in overcoming self-sabotaging behavior and that denying oneself of pleasure often leads to rebound overindulgence in unhealthy behaviors. It is important to find a balance between work and pleasure and to allow oneself to experience positive emotions in order to feel deserving of pleasure. Relaxation and positive emotions are rejuvenating and can help provide a clear perspective on stressful situations.

The chapter offers five experiments to identify potential sources of positive emotions. The author encourages readers to identify their own simple pleasures that feel luxurious and personal to them. Examples of simple pleasures that the author finds luxurious include browsing the aisles at a grocery store leisurely, taking long showers, listening to podcasts and audiobooks, going for evening strolls, and talking to family members on Skype.

The author suggests that any of these positively toned self-reflection questions can be treated as discussion topics for conversations with family and friends. It is important to include items on the list that can be done anywhere and in small bites of time. The author also notes that some simple pleasures can feel like a chore depending on the context. For example, cleaning the leaves out of a swimming pool can be pleasurable if done as a break from work, but unpleasant if it is just one chore on a long list of tasks.

Pairing pleasure with stressful situations can help buffer the effects of stress. For example, packing a favorite snack for a flight can make the experience more enjoyable. The author encourages readers to think about what pleasure they can pair with infrequent stressful activities to make them easier and more enjoyable.

Understanding one's own nature and what brings pleasure can help structure one's life to include more opportunities for mood boosts. The author shares personal examples of how introverts can enjoy brief interactions with strangers while traveling, despite being introverted. Readers are encouraged to think about what is pleasurable for them that reflects a non-dominant part of their nature and how exploring these behaviors can provide a better understanding of their whole selves.

In addition to self-care and pleasure, the author discusses the importance of identifying one's central purpose in life and taking actions that align with that purpose. When people make progress towards their purpose, they experience a greater sense of well-being. The author encourages readers to think about their central purpose and the actions that relate to that purpose in their day-to-day lives.

The chapter also discusses strategies for coping with negative emotions. The author explains that all emotions have evolved to benefit us in some way and that uncomfortable emotional states can lead to more creative thinking, better decision making, and more accurate performance. The author provides a quick tour of the major purposes of different emotions, such as anger energizing us for action, anxiety motivating us to do the right thing, and sadness causing us to reflect on our values. Understanding the positive purposes of negative emotions can help one take them in stride more easily.

The author provides a strategy for coping with negative emotions that involves slow breathing to reduce physiological arousal, accurately labeling emotions, accepting and tolerating negative emotions, and identifying the purpose of the emotion and taking appropriate action. The author also provides examples of self-sabotaging responses to specific emotions, such as avoiding what makes you anxious or withdrawing socially when feeling lonely. The author suggests more useful responses, such as using slow breathing to reduce anxiety, seeking out meaningful relationships when feeling lonely, and seeking feedback rather than avoiding it when feeling doubt.

Stress is also discussed in the chapter and the author explains that the negative effects of stress often occur because stress disrupts self-care routines. Examples of self-care routines that can be disrupted by stress include de-stressing activities, socializing, and organizing. It is important to prioritize self-care during times of stress and to be aware of the signs when a break is needed.

The chapter ends with a reminder that self-care does not decrease productivity and that practicing self-care leads to better decision making and a clearer perspective on life. The author encourages readers to reflect on the chapter and answer questions about the main takeaways and how to integrate more pleasure and self-care into their lives.
