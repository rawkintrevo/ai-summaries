In this part of the book, the author focuses on helping individuals reduce self-sabotage in various types of relationships. The first two chapters discuss strategies for committed, nonabusive couples in long-term romantic relationships, while the third chapter covers friendships and work relationships.

The author explains that the quality of our bonds with others is crucial for overall life satisfaction. Research has shown that to sustain relationship contentment, partners need to have at least five positive interactions for every one negative exchange. Couples who are arguing frequently tend to overlook the importance of increasing positive interactions. Conversely, couples who are drifting apart also need to increase positive exchanges to strengthen their bond.

The author suggests that improving a positive bond should be the first focus before attempting to reduce arguments. Without a positive bond, there won't be a spirit of cooperation during arguments. To care about someone in the midst of an argument, one needs to activate their sense of positive attachment. The challenge is that one won't feel like being warm and loving with their partner when their positive bond is low. However, by acting loving, the change in thoughts and emotions will happen automatically.

The author provides a list of micro-actions for increasing the positive bond in relationships. These actions are simple and quick, such as calling your partner by an affectionate nickname, making a positive comment about one of your partner's friends, or giving your partner a shoulder rub. By incorporating these actions into daily life, individuals can strengthen their bond and improve their overall relationship satisfaction.

The author then discusses the importance of growth in relationships. In the beginning stages of a relationship, growth happens easily as individuals are exposed to new interests and habits through their partner. However, as relationships progress, the sense of growth can stall. The author suggests engaging in activities that promote growth, such as asking your partner's opinion on a topic you don't know much about or proactively bringing up a topic your partner has wanted to discuss. This deliberate effort to grow together can reinvigorate the relationship.

Finally, the author introduces the concept of perspective taking. This technique involves considering the other person's point of view in a situation. By practicing perspective taking, individuals can better understand their partner's emotions and reactions and choose more effective behaviors for influencing them. The author provides steps for engaging in perspective taking and suggests using visual and psychological distance to gain a clearer perspective.

Overall, the strategies and techniques discussed in this part of the book aim to reduce self-sabotage in relationships and promote overall relationship satisfaction. By increasing positive interactions, fostering growth, and practicing perspective taking, individuals can improve their bond with their partner and create a happier, more fulfilling relationship.
