Chapter 12 of the book provides guidance on what to do next after understanding the process of tax lien and tax deed investing. The chapter emphasizes the importance of focusing on residential properties, particularly three-bed, two-bath suburban homes, as they are in high demand. However, the chapter also acknowledges that investors can explore other property types such as agricultural, commercial, or industrial properties if they have specialized knowledge or a personal preference.

The chapter advises investors to be cautious when considering nonresidential properties, as they may come with additional challenges such as EPA issues for industrial buildings. It is recommended that investors take extra care and conduct thorough due diligence when venturing outside their familiar area.

The first decision investors need to make is which state to invest in. The book provides tables that offer insights into the financial aspects of tax lien states, such as the rate of return if the property is redeemed and the period required for foreclosure. Investors should choose states they are willing to visit in person, as remote investing is not recommended. Factors such as the amount of paperwork involved and the assistance provided by authorities should also be considered. States with online bidding systems may be appealing, but it should never replace physically visiting the property.

After choosing a state, investors need to pick a county to target. The book suggests looking for counties with friendly and helpful staff who can provide valuable local knowledge. Counties that have put records and maps online can also facilitate investors' research. The book recommends obtaining a list of delinquent properties and discussing the generalities of the county with county employees to gain insights into residential, commercial, agricultural, and rural areas.

Once investors have a list of potential properties, they should examine the assessed value of the land and improvements. Properties where the improvements are more valuable than the land are usually a better choice. The book also suggests reaching out to the planning department to obtain information on municipal improvements, zoning, and floodplain designations. Using websites like realtor.com can provide further insights into the local housing market.

Investors should also research any other liens or mortgages on the property. The county recorder or county clerk can provide information on possible difficulties. Inspecting the properties in person is crucial before making a purchase. Investors should visit the area, meet with county officials, and tour the properties. While it may be challenging to inspect the inside of buildings, this step allows investors to gather firsthand information and clear up any errors or omissions in county records. It is also a chance to develop a good working relationship with county staff.

After conducting thorough research and inspecting the properties, investors can identify the ones they want to bid on. They should then return to the county offices to complete the necessary steps to become registered as an eligible bidder in the auction. This may involve filling out a W-9 form for the IRS and clarifying deposit and payment requirements.

If required by the county, investors may need to attend the auction in person. Live auctions can be intimidating for some, but paying attention to the auctioneer and bidding on the correct lot can mitigate any potential issues. It is essential to ensure compliance with funding requirements if the bid is successful to avoid legal consequences.

In summary, Chapter 12 provides a step-by-step guide on what to do next in tax lien and tax deed investing. It emphasizes the selection of residential properties, conducting thorough research, inspecting properties in person, and participating in auctions. It also highlights the importance of building relationships with county officials and following all necessary procedures and regulations.
