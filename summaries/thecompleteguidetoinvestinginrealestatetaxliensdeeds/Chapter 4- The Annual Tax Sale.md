Chapter 4 of the book is titled "The Annual Tax Sale" and discusses the process of tax sales in different states and the requirements for participating in these auctions. The chapter begins by explaining that most tax deed states hold periodic delinquent property tax sales, while tax lien states typically hold annual property tax sales. 

The chapter then discusses tax sale listings, which are published by most municipalities in local newspapers prior to the tax sale. These listings include information about properties with delinquent taxes, such as parcel numbers, legal descriptions, and the amount of delinquent taxes. The listings also include the name and address of the property owner. Some municipalities may also provide additional information about the property, such as zoning information and appraised value.

Next, the chapter explains the registration process for participating in the tax sale auction. Bidders are typically required to provide their Social Security or tax identification number and other identifying information to the taxing municipality. Some municipalities may also require bidders to complete an IRS Form W-9. Bidders may also be required to pay a registration fee or make a minimum deposit. Once registered, bidders are assigned a bidder number and given a bidder card to use during the auction.

The chapter goes on to discuss the schedule of the tax sale and how it may be modified if the auction falls behind schedule. It explains that tax sales can be completed in a single day in some smaller jurisdictions, while larger jurisdictions may set aside several days for the sale. The schedule may be published in advance but can be subject to changes announced during the auction.

The chapter also explains the pace of the auction and the importance of being alert and patient during the bidding process. It warns that distracted bidders may accidentally bid on the wrong property and that bids are typically final and non-refundable. Failure to pay for the purchased tax lien certificates can result in penalties or even imprisonment.

The chapter then discusses restrictions on bids and how some states impose limitations on the number of bids a bidder can make. This can include requiring a deposit for each bid, using a different Social Security or tax identification number for each bidder number, or allowing only one bid per bidder number. The chapter suggests that investors can overcome these restrictions by bringing associates to the auction or using different identifiers for each bidder number.

The chapter also explains different opportunities for investing in tax lien certificates, including the annual tax sale, over-the-counter sales, and online auctions. It points out that the annual tax sale offers limited opportunities for investors since it is usually held once a year and in some states, all counties hold their tax sales on the same day. Over-the-counter sales provide an opportunity to purchase unsold tax lien certificates after the tax sale, while online auctions offer the convenience of bidding from anywhere.

Finally, the chapter discusses the payment process for purchasing tax lien certificates and the different payment methods accepted by municipalities. It explains that certified funds are usually required during the auction, but some municipalities may accept personal checks. The chapter also mentions the process of obtaining the deed for properties that fail to redeem the tax lien certificates and the different types of deeds issued by states.

Overall, Chapter 4 provides a comprehensive overview of the annual tax sale process, including registration, bidding, payment, and the different opportunities available for investing in tax lien certificates.
