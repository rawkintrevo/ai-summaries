Chapter 12 of the book discusses the next steps to take after learning about tax liens and tax deeds. The author recommends starting with residential properties, specifically three-bed, two-bath suburban homes, as these tend to be in high demand. However, the author also mentions that it's possible to explore agricultural, commercial, or industrial properties if one has specialized knowledge or a particular interest in those areas. The author advises caution when venturing into non-residential properties due to potential issues such as EPA regulations for industrial buildings.

The chapter advises researching and choosing a state to focus on for tax lien or tax deed purchases. The decision should be based on factors such as the rate of return and the time required for legal foreclosure in the state. It is also important to consider the amount of paperwork involved and the level of assistance provided by authorities in the state. Online bidding may be preferable for some investors, but physical presence at auctions may be required in other states. Additionally, the deposit and payment terms should be considered when selecting a state.

The next step is to choose a county within the selected state. The author suggests looking for counties with friendly and helpful staff, preferably in rural areas where they may be less busy. It is also beneficial to find counties that have made their records and maps available online, as this facilitates the research process. Speaking with county employees can provide valuable insights into areas to focus on and delinquent properties.

Once a county is selected, the investor needs to research the properties they are interested in. This involves examining the assessed value of the land and improvements, as properties where the improvements are more valuable than the land are often a better choice. The planning department can provide information on any planned municipal improvements, zoning regulations, and floodplain designations. The investor should also investigate any other liens or mortgages on the property that could affect the purchase.

After conducting research, the chapter advises investors to visit the area to inspect the properties in person. This allows investors to determine if the properties are worth investing in, as well as correct any errors or omissions in county records. While it may not be possible to inspect the interiors of buildings, visiting the county office and assessor's office can provide additional information and help develop a good working relationship with the staff. The investor should also check for any environmental issues or Superfund sites through the EPA.

If allowed by the county, investors may have to attend the auction in person. The chapter assures readers that attending live auctions is not as daunting as it may seem, as long as they pay attention to the auctioneer. It is important to bid on the desired property and comply with funding requirements if successful. Failure to meet payment requirements could result in legal action.

In conclusion, this chapter provides a step-by-step guide to the next actions an investor should take after learning about tax liens and tax deeds. It emphasizes the importance of careful research, selecting the right state and county, inspecting properties, and participating in auctions. Following these steps will help investors make informed decisions and increase their chances of successful tax lien or tax deed purchases.
