Chapter 7 of the book discusses the various methods of obtaining investment dollars for tax lien certificate investments. One of the most commonly used methods is forming a partnership or investment group. Partners work together to research and bid on investment properties and then split the profits. Another source of investment dollars is an individual's retirement plan. Investing in tax lien certificates within a retirement plan can provide tax benefits and increase the funds in the plan. 

The chapter also emphasizes the importance of understanding tax laws when investing in tax lien certificates. It is recommended to have an accountant or attorney who is knowledgeable in tax liens and business taxes as part of the partnership. They can provide advice and help reduce tax obligations. The return on investment for tax lien certificates is affected by taxes, so it is important to have expert knowledge and advice in tax laws, real estate taxes, investments, and contracts.

Different business entities, such as corporations, limited liability companies, general partnerships, real estate investment trusts, and limited partnerships, are discussed as possible structures for investment partnerships. Each entity has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of liability protection and tax implications. The choice of entity should be based on the specific needs and goals of the partners.

The chapter also discusses the importance of having a partnership agreement that clearly outlines the purpose, goals, contributions, finances, distribution of profits, and management of the partnership. It should also include provisions for dispute resolution, sale and assignment of partnership interests, expulsion of partners, and loss of a partner. The agreement should address different scenarios, such as the death or illness of a partner, and provide procedures for adding new partners or dissolving the partnership. Consultation with an attorney is recommended to ensure that the partnership agreement is legally sound and protects the interests of all partners.

Overall, this chapter emphasizes the importance of obtaining investment dollars and understanding tax laws when investing in tax lien certificates. Forming a partnership or investment group and utilizing retirement plans can provide the necessary funds for investments. Having expert knowledge and advice in tax laws and real estate taxes is crucial for reducing tax obligations and maximizing returns. A well-drafted partnership agreement is essential for structuring the partnership and protecting the interests of all partners.
