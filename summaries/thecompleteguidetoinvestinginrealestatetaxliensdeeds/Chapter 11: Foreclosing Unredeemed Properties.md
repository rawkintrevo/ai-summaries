Foreclosing Unredeemed Properties

Chapter 11 of the book discusses the process of foreclosing tax lien certificates on properties that have not been redeemed by the property owner. In tax lien states, property owners have the opportunity to redeem their tax lien certificates before the investor can foreclose on the property. In some deed states, property owners also have the opportunity to redeem properties sold at tax deed sales. If the property owner fails to redeem the tax lien certificate, the investor can then foreclose the right to redemption and obtain title to the property.

Before the investor can foreclose the right of redemption, they must first pay all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and costs associated with the property. The amount that needs to be paid will depend on the redemption period, with longer redemption periods resulting in higher costs. For example, the redemption period in Arizona is four to five years, while certain municipalities in Maryland have a redemption period of just six months.

There are two types of foreclosures that can occur: administrative filing of foreclosure and force of sale foreclosure. Administrative filing of foreclosure is a nonjudicial foreclosure process used in most tax lien states. In this process, the investor must notify the municipality of their desire to foreclose and pay any administrative fees required. They must also complete the necessary paperwork and provide notice to the property owner. If the property owner cannot be located, notice may be posted on the property or in a local paper. The investor must also pay any other tax liens or government liens on the property.

Force of sale foreclosure is a foreclosure process used in most tax deed states. The investor follows a similar process as in administrative filing of foreclosure, but the municipality is responsible for handling the issuance of all notices and setting the date for the sale. The property owner is given additional time to redeem the property before it is auctioned on the specified date. The party named on the tax deed receives preference at the sale and is given a credit for holding the first position lien. If no bids exceed the credit amount, the named party acquires the property. If a bid exceeds the credit amount, the property is sold to the highest bidder.

In both types of foreclosure, it is recommended that investors hire legal representation to ensure that the proper procedures are followed. This is especially important in cases where a quiet title action may be necessary. A quiet title action is a legal claim against potential claimants of the foreclosed property, which provides the investor with a court declaration that the title to the property is good. This declaration protects the investor against any challenges to the foreclosure process and allows them to sell the property with a clear title.

There are several hindrances to foreclosing on properties, including bankruptcy, destruction of the property, and environmental issues. When a property owner files for bankruptcy, it can delay or eliminate any efforts to foreclose on a tax lien certificate. There are different types of bankruptcy, including liquidation (Chapter 7) and reorganization (Chapters 11 and 13). Liquidation bankruptcy eliminates the opportunity to foreclose on a tax lien certificate, while reorganization bankruptcy allows the property owner to continue making payments to creditors.

Destruction of the property can also hinder foreclosure efforts, especially if the property is damaged or destroyed by fire, vandalism, or a natural disaster. In such cases, the property owner may receive insurance coverage for repairs or total destruction. However, if there is no insurance coverage, the equity in the tax lien certificate may be reduced.

Environmental issues are another hindrance to foreclosure, especially in commercial and industrial properties. These properties are more likely to have environmental contamination, and property owners may default on their property taxes to avoid the expense of an environmental cleanup. This can impact the value of the property and the potential return on investment for the tax lien certificate holder.

After foreclosure, the investor becomes the owner of the property and has all the responsibilities of a homeowner. They may need to acquire hazard insurance to cover any potential losses, especially if there are existing occupants on the property. The investor must also consider any other costs associated with the property, such as other tax liens, federal and state liens, quiet title fees, attorney's fees, environmental inspections, cleanup, and eviction of existing occupants.

Overall, foreclosing on unredeemed properties can be a complex process that requires careful attention to legal procedures and potential hindrances. Investors are encouraged to seek legal advice and thoroughly research properties before making any investment decisions.
