Chapter 8 discusses the various outcomes and strategies that investors in tax lien certificates may seek. The first outcome is to profit from the return mandated for redemption amounts. This involves investing in liens against properties that are likely to be redeemed. The second outcome is to assign the certificate to another party for a fee. This requires finding liens that present a favorable opportunity for other investors. The third outcome is to take ownership of the property securing the certificate, which typically occurs in less than 10 percent of cases.

The chapter also explores the concept of interest rates and how they impact the return on investment. State statutes require property owners to pay penalties, interest, or both in order to redeem a tax lien certificate. The interest rate on redemption amounts is usually fixed, while the penalty amount is usually applied at the same rate, regardless of when redemption takes place. The chapter provides examples from different states, such as Indiana and New Jersey, to illustrate how these rates and penalties are applied.

In addition to interest rates, investors also consider the percentage yield when determining the suitability of investment opportunities. Yield measures how quickly an investor receives a return on their investment, and it takes into account the timeliness of the return from redemption. The chapter provides examples of how yield is calculated in different states, such as Wyoming. It also highlights states that offer high yields, such as Arizona, Connecticut, and Florida.

The chapter also discusses the concept of flipping, which refers to transferring ownership of a tax lien certificate or equity purchasing contract. Investors may flip a contract to another investor for a profit, without having to fulfill the contractual obligations themselves. Alternatively, they may assign the contract to another investor for a fee, while the new investor takes on the responsibilities of fulfilling the contractual obligations. The chapter provides an example of flipping an equity purchasing contract and calculating the return on investment.

Overall, this chapter provides valuable information on the different outcomes and strategies that investors in tax lien certificates can pursue. It explains the impact of interest rates and penalties on the return on investment, as well as the concept of flipping and assigning contracts. This information is useful for investors looking to maximize their returns in this investment strategy.
