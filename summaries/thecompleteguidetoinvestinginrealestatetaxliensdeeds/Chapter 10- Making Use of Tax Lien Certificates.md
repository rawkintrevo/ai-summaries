Chapter 10 of the book discusses the process of making use of tax lien certificates to make money. It explains that in order to profit from tax lien certificates, investors need to understand and follow the procedures established by each state. The chapter covers topics such as tax lien certificate assignments, collecting redemption amounts, lien priorities, state lien priority, federal lien priority, bankruptcy, and lien priorities.

Tax lien certificate assignments are a way for investors to transfer their rights, responsibilities, and interest in a tax lien certificate to another investor in exchange for a fee. These assignments need to be recorded by the taxing municipality to be valid. Assignments can be made during the redemption period, and the assignee then has all the rights and responsibilities of the original lien holder, including the ability to foreclose on the property.

Collecting redemption amounts is an important part of the tax lien certificate process. When a tax lien certificate is redeemed by the property owner, the tax collector collects the payment and records the assignment. The tax collector then issues a check to the investor for the redemption proceeds. This process can take days or weeks, depending on the workload of the tax collector's office.

Lien priorities are an important consideration when investing in tax lien certificates. Tax liens generally have first priority over other liens, such as mortgage liens. However, in some states, state-held liens have priority over tax liens. This means that if there is an outstanding state-held lien on a property, the tax lien certificate may not provide any security. Investors need to research properties to determine if there are any outstanding debts or liens that could affect the value of the tax lien certificate.

The chapter also explains that federal liens can be placed on properties for nonpayment of government debts. These liens have priority after the expiration of the first redemption period. The IRS has 120 days from the date of the deed sale to redeem all lien certificates. If the IRS does not redeem within this period, its lien is extinguished. Bankruptcies can also affect the process of redeeming and foreclosing tax lien certificates. Bankruptcy laws allow for a stay of claims against the individual who has filed for bankruptcy, including claims by tax lien certificate holders. However, property tax liens maintain their priority throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.

Overall, Chapter 10 provides a detailed overview of the process of making use of tax lien certificates to make money. It covers the assignment of tax lien certificates, collecting redemption amounts, lien priorities, state and federal lien priority, and the impact of bankruptcy on tax lien certificates. Investors interested in purchasing tax lien certificates will find this chapter to be a valuable resource for understanding the necessary procedures and strategies to maximize their return on investment.
