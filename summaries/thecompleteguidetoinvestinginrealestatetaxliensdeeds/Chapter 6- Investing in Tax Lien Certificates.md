Chapter 6 of the book discusses investing in tax lien certificates. It explains that tax sales are open to the public, but the process is complex, so attendees are usually limited to apprehensive citizens and investors. The majority of attendees are investors who purchase tax lien certificates for two reasons: to gain ownership of valuable property for a low price, or to profit from the high rate of return offered by redemption amounts.

The chapter first explores the objective of gaining ownership through tax lien certificates. It explains that tax lien certificates are secured by real estate and offer a fixed rate of interest. Investors aim to invest in certificates that are least likely to be redeemed by the property owner. However, it is difficult to determine which certificates are least likely to be redeemed, so investors are encouraged to rely on the law of averages. For example, if an investor invests in 10 certificates with a 10% chance of not being redeemed, they have a 100% chance of investing successfully in at least one certificate that will not be redeemed. However, property owners usually redeem most tax lien certificates, so the investor's only loss is the money used during the redemption period.

The chapter then discusses opportunities for investing in tax lien certificates before the tax sale. Investors can contact property owners in the tax sale listing and offer to settle the delinquent taxes in three ways: buying equity, sharing equity, or offering a reverse lease option. Buying equity involves buying the owner's equity in the property and taking ownership. Sharing equity involves offering to share equity with the property owner, allowing them to maintain possession of the property while splitting expenses. A reverse lease option involves purchasing the property and leasing it back to the property owner with an option to repurchase in the future.

Next, the chapter explains the process of gaining ownership after the tax sale. To gain ownership, the property owner must fail to redeem the tax lien certificate during the redemption period. The investor must then follow prescribed processes and procedures, which vary by state and municipality, to foreclose the property owner's right to redemption and acquire deed and title to the property.

Finally, the chapter explores the objective of a high rate of return through redemption. When property owners redeem tax lien certificates, they must reimburse the certificate holder for the delinquent tax amount, plus interest, penalties, fees, and costs associated with the certificate. The additional charges vary by state, but generally, the combination of penalties and interest over the redemption period provides a favorable return for investors.

The chapter also briefly discusses the types of investors: independent investors and institutional investors. Independent investors are small investors with limited funds, while institutional investors are large corporate investors with millions of dollars available for investment. Institutional investors tend to be more skilled in the bidding process and may have specific strategies for maximizing yield.

Overall, the chapter provides an overview of investing in tax lien certificates and the different strategies and objectives that investors may have. It emphasizes the potential for both gaining ownership of valuable property and earning a high rate of return through redemption.
