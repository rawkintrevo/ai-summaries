Chapter 1 introduces the concept of a tax lien certificate, which is a document that serves as evidence of indebtedness against a parcel of real estate. It explains that when property owners fail to pay property taxes, the property may be auctioned off and sold at a tax sale. Some states engage in the sale of deeds to recoup losses from delinquent property taxes, while other states engage in the sale of liens against the property. The purchase of a tax deed is different from the purchase of a tax lien. In tax deed states, the winning bidder at a tax sale purchases ownership of the property, while in tax lien states, the investor pays the delinquent tax on behalf of the property owner and receives a certificate indicating payment of the tax lien. 

The chapter then discusses the different types of tax deed states. Some states, known as hybrid tax deed states, allow the previous property owner to redeem the property from the new owner within a specified time period. These states include Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Guam, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas. Other tax deed states, known as pure tax deed states, do not provide the previous property owner with an opportunity to redeem the property. These states include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.
