The author begins by sharing his personal experience with the tax lien process. He had owned a house in Arizona and had always paid property taxes through his mortgage company. However, when he paid off his mortgage, he discovered that his taxes had not been paid and were going to auction. He had not been receiving tax statements because the address on file was incorrect, and the county did not make any effort to track down the owner. Furthermore, the author learned that tax liens were sold quickly following non-payment, even if it had only been one missed payment. This led him to become aware of the "profit from tax liens" industry.

The author attempted to become involved in the business but had little success. He purchased an Internet course but found that it did not provide enough detail. He then discovered the book in question, which provides more comprehensive information at a lower cost. Despite his initial negative experience with tax liens, the author notes that his positive credit rating remained intact due to the county's policy of not reporting delinquency.

The first edition of the book received positive reviews but also had some criticisms. In this revised edition, the author has taken into account the negative feedback and made improvements. One major revision was adding website addresses for county treasury departments that handle tax lien and tax deed sales. While some of these listings may be out of date, the majority of them should be usable. The author personally viewed each of the listed websites for current relevance.

The author also includes a final chapter that outlines the basic process of participating in tax lien and tax deed auctions. This chapter was added in response to readers' comments that the book lacked a step-by-step action plan. While each municipality has its own process, the author provides a general framework that can be easily followed and adapted to local regulations.

Overall, the author hopes that this revised edition will provide more comprehensive information and address any concerns raised by readers. He believes that this book will be valuable for individuals interested in investing in tax liens or tax deeds and provides a detailed guide to the process.
