Chapter 5 of the book discusses the process of bidding on tax lien certificates. It explains that the minimum bid for a tax lien certificate is typically equal to the delinquent property taxes, penalties, and interest on the delinquent tax amount, as well as fees and costs associated with issuing the certificate. However, some states have a minimum bid requirement of the appraised value or a percentage of it. 

The chapter then goes on to discuss the different types of bidding processes that can be used. In competitive bidding, bidders can either bid up the cost of the tax lien certificate or bid down the return on the certificate. Bidding up the cost, also known as premium bidding, involves auctioning the certificate to the bidder who is willing to pay the highest amount above the opening bid. Bidding down the return allows bidders to bid down the percentage of ownership in the property or the percentage of interest to be paid upon redemption.

The chapter provides examples of states that use premium bidding, such as Indiana and Mississippi. In Indiana, a penalty is assessed against the opening bid amount if the certificate is redeemed within a certain timeframe, and the premium amount is refunded upon redemption. In Mississippi, an annual interest rate is applied to the opening bid amount, but no interest is applied to the premium amount.

The chapter also discusses bidding down ownership, which involves selling tax lien certificates to the bidder who offers to purchase a lesser percentage of interest in the property. The chapter explains that if the property owner fails to redeem the certificate, the bidder may foreclose the property and receive a treasurer's deed, which grants them partial ownership of the property. The original property owner retains the remaining percentage of ownership, and both parties become tenants-in-common.

Examples of states that allow bidding down ownership are Missouri and New Hampshire. In Missouri, the tax sale is limited to residents of the municipality, and individuals residing outside the municipality must designate a resident agent to bid on their behalf. In New Hampshire, property owners are allowed to redeem their share of the tax lien certificate to retain their share of tenancy-in-common ownership.

The chapter also mentions bidding down interest, which allows bidders to purchase a tax lien certificate with a lower redemption interest rate than what is specified by state statute. Arizona and New Jersey are given as examples of states that allow bidding down interest.

In addition to competitive bidding, the chapter briefly discusses noncompetitive bidding in states such as Oklahoma and Wyoming. In these states, tax lien certificates are offered on a first-come, first-served basis, and the treasurer is responsible for choosing a winning bidder if multiple bidders offer to pay for the same certificate. The chapter explains that noncompetitive bidding methods include first-come, first-served methods and lottery-type methods.

Lastly, the chapter mentions that in many states, unsold tax lien certificates are made available for resale over the counter. These certificates are not subject to the bidding process and are sold for 100 percent interest in the property. The chapter states that purchasing tax lien certificates over the counter offers advantages such as more time for research and assistance from personnel at the treasurer's office.

Overall, Chapter 5 provides a comprehensive overview of the bidding process for tax lien certificates, including different types of bidding and examples from various states.
