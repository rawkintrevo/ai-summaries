Chapter 10: Making Use of Tax Lien Certificates

This chapter discusses the process of making money from tax lien certificates and the procedures involved in assigning, redeeming, and foreclosing tax lien certificates. It explains how tax lien certificates can be assigned to another party for a fee and the recording process involved in the assignment. It also discusses the collection of redemption amounts when tax lien certificates are redeemed, as well as the payment process and the importance of notifying tax collectors of any address changes.

The chapter also discusses lien priorities and how tax liens are generally in first position against a property. It explains that other liens against a property, such as federal, state, or local government liens, may also exist. It emphasizes the need for investors to research properties before acquiring tax lien certificates to ensure that there are no outstanding debts that could affect the security of the investment. It also explains that tax liens have priority over other liens, except for certain government liens, and provides examples of lien priority scenarios in different states.

The chapter also discusses the priority of federal liens and the impact of bankruptcies on the redemption and foreclosure process of tax lien certificates. It explains that federal bankruptcy laws can order a stay of claims against individuals who have filed for bankruptcy, including tax lien certificate holders. However, property tax liens still have the highest priority in bankruptcy proceedings, and tax lien holders are considered secured creditors. The chapter advises tax lien certificate holders to consider the cost-effectiveness of pursuing a claim in bankruptcy court when a certificate is secured by the property of a bankrupt party.

Overall, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the process of making money from tax lien certificates, including the assignment, redemption, and foreclosure processes, as well as the importance of researching properties and understanding lien priorities. It highlights the need for investors to understand and follow the procedures established by municipalities in order to maximize their return on investment from tax lien certificates.
