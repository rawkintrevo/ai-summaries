Chapter 6 discusses the investment opportunities presented by tax lien certificates. Tax lien certificates are offered at annual tax sales and are open to the public, but the process is complex and not well understood. Therefore, attendees at tax sales are usually limited to citizens with a vested interest in properties and investors.

Investors purchase tax lien certificates for two main reasons: to gain ownership of valuable property for a low price or to profit from the high rate of return through redemption amounts. To maximize their return on investment, investors try to invest in lien certificates that are secured by valuable property and are least likely to be redeemed by the property owner. However, it is difficult to determine which certificates are least likely to be redeemed, so investors have to rely on the law of averages. They invest in certificates that have as little as a 10% chance of not being redeemed, using the law of averages to increase their chances of success.

If an investor fails to gain ownership of a property through a tax lien certificate, they can still profit from the high rate of return offered by redemption. When property owners redeem tax lien certificates, they must reimburse the certificate holder for the delinquent tax amount, as well as interest, penalties, fees, and costs associated with the certificate. Different states have different methods of determining these additional amounts, but they can range from 6% to 24% interest annually. The redemption period also varies by state, but generally ranges from six months to four years.

There are also opportunities for investors to invest in tax lien certificates before the tax sale begins. Investors can contact property owners listed on the tax sale listing and offer to settle the delinquent tax amount in one of three ways: buying equity, sharing equity, or offering a reverse lease option. Buying equity involves purchasing the owner's equity in the property and taking ownership. Sharing equity involves offering to share equity with the property owner. A reverse lease option involves purchasing the property and leasing it back to the owner with an option for the owner to repurchase the property in the future.

There are two primary types of investors: independent investors and institutional investors. Independent investors are small investors with limited funds, while institutional investors are large corporate investors with millions of dollars available for investment. Institutional investors are skilled in the bidding process and are more focused on properties with higher market values.

Overall, investing in tax lien certificates can offer a relatively safe and reliable investment opportunity, whether the objective is to gain ownership of valuable property or to profit from the high rate of return through redemption. However, it is important for investors to carefully research and understand the specific processes and procedures involved in their state or municipality.
