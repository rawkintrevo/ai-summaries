Chapter 2 of the provided text discusses delinquent properties and how they relate to real property taxes in the United States. It states that all real property, except for Indian reservations, is subject to real property taxes, which are assessed based on the value of the property. The taxes are used by the state and taxing municipalities to provide services to the community. When property owners fail to pay their taxes within the specified time frame, the taxes become delinquent. This creates a shortfall for the governing municipality and disrupts its ability to provide services. To encourage property owners to pay their taxes, penalties, interest, and costs are assessed against the delinquent property. The property or a lien against the property may also be offered for sale at a real property tax sale.

The chapter then goes on to discuss various types of delinquent properties. Single-family housing units make up the largest percentage of properties with tax lien certificates offered for sale. These properties offer profit potential because owners are likely to redeem the tax lien against their property. Single-family homes that are also owner-occupied offer the greatest chance of redemption. Multiple-family housing units, such as duplexes and apartment buildings, are usually owned by companies and generate income for the owner. These properties also offer profit potential, as the tax liens against smaller housing units are more affordable and more likely to be redeemed.

Homestead properties, which are occupied properties where occupants have filed an exemption for property taxes, offer profit potential because the property is likely to be the owner's principal residence. Owners of homestead properties are not interested in losing their accommodations and are likely to redeem any tax liens quickly. Mortgaged properties are also likely to be redeemed by the mortgage lender, as the property provides security for the mortgage loan. Mortgage companies have a vested interest in redeeming tax liens to protect their loan against foreclosure by the tax lien certificate holder.

The chapter also discusses worthless properties, such as vacant lots and abandoned properties, which may not offer much value to investors. Vacant lots may not be suitable for development and may be landlocked or not served by utilities. The investor must research the zoning regulations, access to water and sewage disposal systems, and any environmental issues that may affect the property. Abandoned properties with dilapidated structures may have accrued delinquent taxes over the years and may not be worth the amount advertised for tax sale purposes.

Commercial properties can also be worthless to investors who are not skilled in commercial real estate. These properties may have structures that indicate a useful business purpose, but they may not be compliant with zoning and other regulations and may be too expensive to bring into compliance.

Overall, the chapter highlights the importance of researching delinquent properties before investing in tax lien certificates. It emphasizes the need to consider factors such as property type, occupancy status, mortgage status, and the potential for redemption.
