Chapter 3 of the provided content discusses the income and growth potential of investing in tax lien certificates. Tax lien certificates offer a safe investment option because they are secured by real estate. The income potential of tax lien certificates is realized when a property owner redeems the tax lien certificate. The property owner has to pay the delinquent tax amount plus any assessed interest and penalties, which guarantees the investor to collect the investment amount with interest. The interest continues to accrue throughout the redemption period, offering growth potential. 

Even if the property owner fails to redeem the tax lien certificate, the investor has the option to foreclose the right of redemption and gain ownership of the property at a fraction of its value. This newly owned property offers both income and growth potential, as it can be sold at market value for an amount higher than the initial investment or rented out to generate income over time.

The risks associated with tax lien certificate investments are relatively small compared to other investment opportunities. However, it is important for investors to develop strategies to manage and minimize risk. Consulting with an experienced accountant and attorney can help eliminate and minimize investment risks. Diversification and dollar cost averaging are also important techniques for risk management.

There are several types of risks in investments, including market risk, safety risk, liquidity risk, and overhead risk. Market risk refers to the risk of an investment selling for less than the amount invested. Tax lien certificates offer negligible market risk because property owners are required to pay the interest and other costs for redemption or risk losing their property. Safety risk refers to the risk of investing in an unsecured investment. Tax lien certificates are secured by real estate, making them a safe investment option. Liquidity risk refers to the risk of an investment not being easily convertible to cash. Tax lien certificates offer limited liquidity, but the return on investment is guaranteed to exceed the cost of acquiring the certificate. Overhead risk refers to the risk of taking a loss in the operation of a business entity. Expenses associated with tax lien investment opportunities are not considered overhead expenses but part of the cost of investing.

A comparison between tax lien certificates and other investment opportunities is provided in Table 3. Tax lien certificates offer income and growth potential, minimal market risk, safety, high overhead risk, and limited liquidity. Other investment opportunities, such as residential real estate, rental real estate, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, and money market funds have varying degrees of income and growth potential, market risk, safety, liquidity, and overhead risk.

In conclusion, investing in tax lien certificates can provide a safe investment option with income and growth potential. The risks associated with tax lien certificate investments are relatively small compared to other investment opportunities. However, it is important for investors to develop strategies to manage and minimize risk. Tax lien certificates offer minimal market risk, safety, and overhead risk, as well as limited liquidity. Overall, tax lien certificates provide a viable investment opportunity with consistent income and growth potential.
