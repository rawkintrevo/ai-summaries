Chapter 5 of the book discusses the process of bidding on tax lien certificates. The chapter explains that the public is generally allowed to participate in auctions and bid on properties with delinquent property taxes. The opening bid for a tax lien certificate is usually equal to the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest, as well as fees and costs associated with issuing the certificate. However, some states have a minimum bid of the appraised value. 

The chapter discusses two types of bidding methods: competitive bidding and noncompetitive bidding. In competitive bidding, bidders can either bid up the cost of the tax lien certificate or bid down the return on the certificate. Bidding up the cost is also known as premium bidding, where bidders bid a higher amount above the opening bid to acquire the certificate. Some states apply interest to the redemption amount based on the opening bid amount or the premium bid amount. The premium amount may be refunded to the certificate holder or the property owner upon redemption or foreclosure.

Bidding down the return on tax lien certificates is a process that allows bidders to bid down the percentage of ownership in the property or the percentage of interest to be paid upon redemption. Bidding down ownership means that bidders bid to purchase a lesser percentage of interest in the property, while bidding down interest means that bidders bid to purchase the certificate with a lower redemption interest rate. 

The chapter also discusses late-entry bidding, which is a psychological technique where a seasoned bidder waits for the bidding frenzy to subside and makes a high offer to shock the last bidder who thought their bid was the winning bid. 

The chapter also explains noncompetitive bidding methods, where tax lien certificates are offered on a first-come, first-served basis. States use different methods to select winning bidders, such as assigning bidder numbers and using a lottery-type system. 

The chapter also mentions over-the-counter tax certificates, which are tax lien certificates that were unsold at the tax sale and are then made available for resale to the public. These certificates are not subject to the bidding process and are sold for 100 percent interest in the property. Purchasing tax lien certificates over the counter offers advantages such as more time for research and the opportunity to acquire 100 percent ownership in the property. 

Overall, this chapter provides an in-depth explanation of the different bidding methods for tax lien certificates and the various factors that investors need to consider when participating in auctions or purchasing over the counter.
