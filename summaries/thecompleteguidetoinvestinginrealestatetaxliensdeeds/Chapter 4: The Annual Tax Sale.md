Chapter 4 discusses the annual tax sale process in tax lien states. It explains that most tax lien states hold annual property tax sales, where available tax lien certificates are auctioned off to the public. To participate in the auction, individuals must register and obtain a bidder number and card. The tax sale listings, which include properties with delinquent taxes, are published in local newspapers or other forms of print media. Some municipalities have also started publishing tax sale listings online.

Registration is required for bidders before they can participate in the auction. This involves providing the taxing municipality with a Social Security or tax identification number, along with other identifying information. Some states require bidders to complete IRS Form W-9. Bidders may also be required to pay a registration fee or make a deposit, which will be applied to the total amount spent on tax lien certificates. The auction is usually held separately from the registration process, and bidders are assigned a bidder number and given a bidder card to use during the auction.

Municipalities have established schedules for completing the tax sale process, but they may sometimes fall behind schedule. This may result in modifications to the schedule being announced during the tax sale or distributed to the participants, without formal publication. In some cases, new listings may be generated but not formally published. Auctioneers and tax sale officials may also switch the bidding system being used if they are behind schedule. Bidders must therefore be patient and alert during the auction process to avoid making mistakes.

Some states impose restrictions on the number of bids that a bidder can make at the auction. These restrictions may require a deposit for each bid opportunity, a different Social Security or tax identification number for each bidder number, or only one bid per bidder number. However, there are ways for investors to overcome these restrictions, such as using associates or registering and bidding with multiple bidder numbers.

There are limited opportunities for investors to invest in tax lien certificates, as most tax sales are held annually. Some investors are able to reinvest funds received from redemption amounts in new tax liens. If tax lien certificates are not sold at the annual tax sale, they may be offered over the counter. In over-the-counter sales, there are no competitive bidders, and certificates are purchased for the minimum amount, including penalties and interest. Some municipalities even allow investors to purchase over-the-counter certificates through the mail, eliminating the need for physical presence at the sale.

Online auctions are another option, where bidders can participate in the auction process online. This allows for more efficiency and accuracy in listing properties for sale and reduces traveling expenses for investors. Payment for tax lien certificates is made to the taxing jurisdiction responsible for the tax sale. Most tax collectors require payment in certified funds, and some may accept personal checks or cash.

Once a property owner fails to redeem a tax lien certificate, an investor may foreclose the right of redemption and obtain the deed for the property. The process of obtaining the deed varies by state, with some states issuing grant deeds, warranty deeds, or a combination of both. In Puerto Rico and Guam, special deeds are used for their tax sale system.

Overall, the chapter provides a detailed overview of the annual tax sale process in tax lien states, including information on registration, bidding, restrictions, payment, and obtaining the deed.
