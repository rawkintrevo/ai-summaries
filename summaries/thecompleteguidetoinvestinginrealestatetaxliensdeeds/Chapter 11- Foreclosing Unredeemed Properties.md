Chapter 11 of the book discusses the process of foreclosing on properties that have not been redeemed after the expiration of the redemption period for tax lien certificates. It explains that tax lien states allow property owners to redeem tax lien certificates, while some deed states also offer property owners the opportunity to redeem properties sold at tax deed sales. If the property owner fails to redeem the certificate, the investor can foreclose the right to redemption and obtain title to the property.

The chapter starts by explaining that before foreclosing the right to redemption, the investor must pay all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and costs. The amount to be paid varies depending on the length of the redemption period, with some states like Arizona having a longer redemption period of four to five years and accumulating higher costs. However, not all foreclosures guarantee that the investor will gain title to the property, as some states may limit the investor's return by reimbursing them for the costs of the tax lien certificate but allowing any remaining equity in the property to be returned to the property owner.

The chapter then goes into detail about the two types of foreclosures: administrative filing of foreclosure and force of sale foreclosure. Administrative filing of foreclosure is the process used in most tax lien states and does not require court proceedings. The investor must notify the municipality of their desire to foreclose and pay any required administrative fees. They must also complete necessary paperwork and send a notice of intent to the property owner. In some states, they may be required to pay all other tax liens and government liens. On the other hand, force of sale foreclosure is used in most tax deed states and requires the tax lien certificate holder to force a sale of the property. The municipality handles the issuance of notices and sets the date for the sale. The property owner is given additional time to redeem the property before it is auctioned. The winning bid at the auction must exceed the lien credit amount established for the party named on the tax deed. If no bids exceed this amount, the named party acquires the property free and clear.

The chapter also discusses the process of quiet title, which is recommended for investors to ensure that the foreclosure procedures have been followed and complied with. A quiet title action provides a court declaration that the title to the property is good and protects the investor against any challenges to the foreclosure process. It is especially important for investors who plan to sell the foreclosed property, as some title companies require this declaration before insuring the title.

The chapter then addresses hindrances to foreclosure, such as bankruptcy, destruction of the property, and environmental issues. Bankruptcy can delay or eliminate foreclosure efforts, and the chapter explains the different types of bankruptcy and their impacts on tax lien certificate holders. Destruction of the property by fire, vandalism, or natural disasters can reduce the value of the property and affect the equity in the tax lien certificate. Environmental issues, particularly in commercial and industrial properties, can pose risks and potential liabilities for investors.

Lastly, the chapter discusses challenges that may arise after foreclosure, such as unlawful detainer actions and adverse possession. Unlawful detainer actions may be necessary to remove occupants who refuse to leave the foreclosed property, while adverse possession or squatter's rights laws may allow individuals who have occupied unoccupied properties for a certain period to claim ownership.

Overall, the chapter provides detailed information on the foreclosure process for tax lien certificates, including the necessary steps, potential hurdles, and considerations for investors. It highlights the importance of understanding the specific procedures and requirements of each state and suggests seeking legal advice to ensure compliance.
