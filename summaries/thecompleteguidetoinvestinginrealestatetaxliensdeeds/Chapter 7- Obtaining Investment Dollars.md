Chapter 7 of a book titled "Investing in Tax Lien Certificates" discusses different methods of obtaining investment funds and the tax considerations involved in tax lien certificate investments.

The chapter begins by discussing the importance of obtaining investment funds for tax lien certificate investments. Unless an investor is independently wealthy, they will need to find ways to obtain the necessary funds. One common method is to form a partnership or investment group, where partners work together to research and bid on investment properties and split the profits. Another source of investment funds is an individual's retirement plan, as investments made in the name of a retirement plan are sheltered from taxation.

The chapter then delves into the tax considerations that investors need to be aware of. It emphasizes the importance of having an accountant or attorney who is knowledgeable in tax liens and business taxes to provide advice and analyze business transactions. It also highlights the fact that the advertised returns on tax lien certificate investments may not be fully realized, as the true return is the amount of money that the investor is able to keep after satisfying tax obligations.

The chapter further explains that tax laws applicable to tax liens and business operations need to be understood by the partnership or investment group. It distinguishes between the roles of an accountant and attorney in the partnership, with the accountant taking a more hands-on approach to the everyday aspects of the business and the attorney overseeing contracts and legal proceedings.

An example is provided to illustrate the tax obligations and deductions associated with starting a new investment venture. It explains that certain deductions, such as startup costs, can be taken in the first year of operation, while other costs need to be amortized over a period of time. The section emphasizes the importance of being knowledgeable about these deductions to offset profits or losses.

The chapter also explores the tax implications of acquiring ownership to a foreclosed property. It explains that the IRS has not established clear guidelines on when a gain is realized in the foreclosure of a tax lien certificate and if it is taxable. It advises investors to consult with their accountants to determine how to best apply the law in their situations.

Another topic covered is the tax benefits of investing in tax lien certificates through retirement programs, such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). It explains that tax lien certificates can be included in a true self-directed IRA, which allows individuals to control their investments outside of the predetermined options offered by the retirement program. It also highlights the caps on contributions to retirement programs and the potential benefits of investing retirement funds in tax lien certificates.

The chapter concludes with a discussion on partnership agreements and the importance of specifying the purpose, goals, and contributions of each partner. It highlights the need for clearly defined terms regarding finances, distribution of profits, account access, general management, dispute resolution, sale and assignment of interests, expulsion or loss of a partner, addition of new partners, and dissolution of the partnership.

Overall, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of obtaining investment dollars for tax lien certificate investments and the tax considerations involved. It emphasizes the importance of seeking professional advice and having a well-defined partnership agreement to ensure a successful investment venture.
