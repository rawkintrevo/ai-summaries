Chapter 8 of the provided content discusses the different outcomes that investors seek when investing in tax lien certificates, as well as the factors that contribute to the return on investment. The three outcomes that investors typically seek when investing in tax lien certificates are:

1. Profiting from the return mandated for redemption amounts: This outcome requires the investor to seek liens against properties that are likely to be redeemed. The investor would receive the redemption amount plus any accumulated interest or penalties.

2. Assigning the certificate to another party for a fee: This outcome requires the investor to seek liens that present a favorable opportunity for other investors. The investor would sell or transfer the certificate to another party for a profit.

3. Taking ownership of the property securing the certificate: This outcome requires the investor to seek properties that are the least likely to be redeemed. This is a relatively low probability event, occurring in less than 10 percent of cases, but it offers the opportunity for property ownership at a fraction of its value.

The chapter also discusses how investors can contact property owners who are delinquent in paying their property taxes before the property incurs a tax lien. In some cases, investors can engage in equity-buying or equity-sharing agreements with the property owner to extinguish existing debts in exchange for ownership of the property or a share of the equity. These agreements can be assigned or flipped to other investors for a profit.

The chapter then delves into the factors that contribute to the return on investment when investing in tax lien certificates, including interest rates and percentage yield. State statutes require property owners to pay penalties, interest, or both to redeem a tax lien certificate. The interest rate on redemption amounts is usually fixed, while the penalty amount is usually applied at the same rate, regardless of when the redemption takes place.

The chapter provides examples of different state laws and how they impact the return on investment. For example, in Indiana, there is a premium bidding system where the premium amount paid by a bidder is subject to interest upon redemption. Indiana also imposes a penalty of 5 percent on the opening bid amount.

In New Jersey, tax lien certificates are sold through competitive bidding, and the interest rate on redemption can be bid down by the winning bidder. There is also a penalty imposed based on the cost of the certificate.

The chapter explains how investors can calculate the time it takes to double an investment using the Rule of 72, which is a formula that divides 72 by the interest rate to determine the number of years it takes to double an investment. The chapter also discusses how yield is calculated and how it represents the percentage of profitability of an investment.

The chapter concludes by discussing the concept of flipping, which is the transfer of ownership of tax lien certificates or equity purchasing contracts. Flipping allows investors to sell or transfer their ownership or contractual rights to another party for a profit without incurring additional expenses.

Overall, this chapter provides valuable information on the different outcomes investors seek when investing in tax lien certificates, as well as the factors that contribute to the return on investment. It highlights the importance of understanding interest rates, penalties, and yield in order to make informed investment decisions.
