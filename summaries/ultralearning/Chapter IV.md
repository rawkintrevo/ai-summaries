In Chapter IV of the book, the author introduces the concept of metalearning, which is learning about learning. The chapter begins with a description of linguist Dan Everett's ability to learn a new language in a short amount of time, even without knowing what language he is learning. The author explains that Everett's success is due to his deep understanding of language structure and his use of a method called "monolingual fieldwork" that was developed as a means of learning indigenous languages.

The author then explains the importance of metalearning in the learning process. Metalearning involves understanding how knowledge is structured and acquired within a subject, and it helps learners to learn more effectively and efficiently. The author gives examples of how metalearning can be applied in various subjects, such as language learning, mathematics, and programming.

The chapter then explores how to draw a metalearning map. The first step is to understand why you are learning a particular skill or subject and how it aligns with your goals. The author suggests using the Expert Interview Method to talk to people who have already achieved what you want to achieve and get their advice. The next step is to break down the skill or subject into concepts, facts, and procedures, and identify the major learning bottlenecks. This analysis helps to determine the areas that need more focus and attention in the learning process.

The author then discusses how to answer the question of how to learn. This involves benchmarking, which means finding common ways in which people learn the skill or subject, and then making modifications based on your goals and priorities. The author introduces the Emphasize/Exclude Method, which involves emphasizing and excluding certain elements of the learning process based on their importance and alignment with your goals.

The chapter concludes by discussing the balance between research and action. The author suggests spending about 10 percent of your total expected learning time on research before starting, and then adjusting your research and learning activities as you go along. The author also emphasizes the long-term benefits of metalearning, which include improved learning methods, better resource management, and increased confidence and motivation.

Overall, the chapter provides a framework for using metalearning to enhance the learning process and achieve better results. By understanding why, what, and how you are learning, and continuously adapting and improving your approach, you can become a more effective and efficient learner.
