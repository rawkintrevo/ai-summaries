Chapter IX: Principle 6—Feedback: Don’t Dodge the Punches

This chapter explores the importance of feedback in the learning process and how it can contribute to skill improvement. It begins by referencing an article about comedian Chris Rock, who uses feedback from his audience to refine his performances and become a better comedian. The author then makes a connection to the field of medicine, where it has been shown that many medical practitioners actually get worse over time instead of improving. This raises the question of why some individuals improve while others do not. The chapter suggests that the key lies in how individuals receive and respond to feedback.

A meta-analysis by Avraham Kluger is referenced, which examines the effects of feedback interventions on performance. The analysis finds that feedback has a positive effect on performance, but the effect is greatly influenced by the type and timing of the feedback. Different types of feedback, such as informative feedback that provides specific information about errors and corrective feedback that provides guidance on how to improve, are discussed. The chapter highlights the importance of informative feedback, which has been shown to be more effective than other types of feedback in promoting learning and skill development.

The chapter explores a study by Michael Herzog and Manfred Fahle that investigates the role of feedback in learning a Vernier discrimination task. The study finds that informative feedback leads to increased learning and better performance on the task. The chapter concludes that the quality of feedback is crucial in promoting skill improvement.

The chapter also references a book by Maria Araceli Ruiz-Primo and Susan Brookhart, which emphasizes the importance of informative feedback in improving learning. The authors argue that feedback should be specific, actionable, and focused on the task or skill at hand. They suggest that feedback should provide information about what was done well, what needs improvement, and how to make those improvements.

Research by James and Chen-Lin Kulik is referenced to highlight the importance of timing in feedback delivery. The researchers find that immediate feedback is more effective than delayed feedback in promoting learning and skill development. They argue that immediate feedback allows for adjustments to be made in real-time, leading to more effective learning.

The chapter also mentions the work of expertise researcher Anders Ericsson and his colleagues. They argue that deliberate practice is crucial for the acquisition of expert performance. Deliberate practice involves engaging in activities that are specifically designed to improve performance through feedback and repetition. The chapter suggests that feedback is an integral part of deliberate practice and plays a crucial role in skill improvement.

However, the chapter acknowledges that not all studies have found positive effects of feedback on learning and performance. A systematic review by Wendy Jaehnig and Matthew Miller indicates that the effectiveness of feedback may depend on various factors, such as the type of instruction and the learner's prior knowledge. The chapter suggests that more research is needed to understand the conditions under which feedback is most effective.

In conclusion, this chapter emphasizes the importance of feedback in promoting skill improvement. Informative feedback that provides specific information and guidance on how to improve is highlighted as the most effective type of feedback. The timing of feedback delivery is also crucial, with immediate feedback being more effective than delayed feedback. The chapter suggests that feedback is an integral part of deliberate practice and plays a crucial role in the acquisition of expertise.
