Chapter I of the book explores the concept of "ultralearning", which is described as an approach to learning that involves pursuing intense, self-directed learning projects and employing specific tactics to complete them successfully. The author shares his own experience with ultralearning, in which he attempted to complete the entire undergraduate computer science curriculum at MIT in one year. Despite not being an MIT student, he was able to access course materials and teach himself the material. The author's project was successful, and he highlights the various strategies he employed to learn efficiently and effectively. 

The chapter also introduces several other individuals who have undertaken their own ultralearning projects. One example is Benny Lewis, who challenged himself to learn a new language in three months and has successfully become fluent in multiple languages using this method. Another example is Roger Craig, who used data analysis and optimization techniques to become a champion on the game show "Jeopardy!". The chapter also features Eric Barone, who taught himself various skills, including pixel art and game development, and went on to create a highly successful video game. 

The author emphasizes that the key to ultralearning is not necessarily how much time is spent studying, but rather the focus and intensity of the learning experience. He suggests that traditional approaches to education often involve a lot of wasted time and inefficient methods of learning. Ultralearning, on the other hand, involves adopting strategies that optimize the learning process and allow for rapid and deep learning. These strategies include setting clear goals, immersing oneself in the subject matter, utilizing technologies and resources to learn in a more efficient way, and deliberately practicing and seeking feedback. 

The chapter concludes by noting that ultralearning can be applied to various fields and areas of interest, not just academic subjects. The author encourages readers to think about how they can apply the principles of ultralearning to their own learning goals and projects. He suggests that with the right plan and effort, anyone can learn anything they set their minds to.
