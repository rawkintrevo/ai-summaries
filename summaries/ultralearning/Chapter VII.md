In this chapter, the author discusses the fourth principle of ultralearning, which is drill. The author begins by discussing the example of Benjamin Franklin, who became a skilled writer through deliberate practice. Franklin used various exercises to improve his writing, such as taking notes on articles from a magazine and comparing them to the original to identify his faults. He also turned prose into verse to expand his vocabulary and improve the flow of his essays.

The author then explains the concept of rate-determining steps in learning, which are the aspects of a skill that have the most impact on overall performance. By identifying and improving these rate-determining steps, learners can progress faster. For example, in learning mathematics, having strong arithmetic skills is crucial for solving problems accurately.

The author goes on to discuss how drills can help learners overcome cognitive load. When practicing a complex skill, attention, memory, and effort are spread across many different aspects of the task. By isolating and practicing specific components of the skill, learners can focus their cognitive resources and improve more efficiently.

The author introduces the Direct-Then-Drill Approach as a way to balance direct practice with drills. Learners should first practice the skill directly in a real-world context, then analyze the skill to identify rate-determining steps or difficult sub-skills, and finally integrate what they've learned back into direct practice.

The author provides tactics for designing drills, such as time slicing, focusing on specific cognitive components, copying aspects of the skill, magnifying certain components, and chaining prerequisites. These tactics can help learners isolate and improve specific aspects of a skill.

The author emphasizes the importance of mindful drilling. Instead of mindlessly practicing drills, learners should understand the purpose and context of the drills and stay motivated to improve their weaknesses. Drills may be challenging, but they provide greater benefits to learning than easy tasks.

Overall, the chapter explores the benefits of drill in ultralearning and provides strategies for implementing drills effectively. By identifying rate-determining steps and focusing on specific components of a skill, learners can improve their performance more efficiently.
