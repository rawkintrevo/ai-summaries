In Chapter XIV of the book, the author discusses the story of the Polgár sisters, particularly focusing on Judit Polgár, who is considered the best female chess player in history. The author highlights the prejudice and skepticism Judit faced from the chess community due to her gender, even though she demonstrated exceptional talent and skill at a young age. The chapter also delves into the unconventional education methods employed by the Polgár family, specifically by their father, László Polgár. 

László Polgár believed that genius could be manufactured through education and training. He decided to raise his three daughters, Zsuzsa, Zsófia, and Judit, to be chess prodigies. The girls started learning chess at an early age, with specialization beginning at age six. László and his wife, Klára, devoted themselves full-time to the girls' education, providing them with the resources and opportunities to excel in chess. The family lived modestly in a cramped apartment, but they were able to create a supportive and nurturing environment for the girls' development.

The Polgár sisters quickly demonstrated their talent, with Zsuzsa becoming a grandmaster and Judit, the youngest, surpassing even her sisters' achievements. Judit's rise in the chess world was met with both admiration and criticism. Some chess players, such as Nigel Short and Mikhail Tal, recognized her genius and predicted a bright future for her. However, Garry Kasparov, a former world champion, expressed skepticism due to his belief in the limitations of the female psyche.

The author recounts a controversial match between Judit and Kasparov, where he made an illegal move that went unchallenged by the referee. Judit's loss in the game further fueled her determination to prove herself in the world of chess. Years later, she had the opportunity for a rematch with Kasparov and emerged as the victor, leading him to revise his earlier assessment of her abilities.

The Polgár sisters' success in chess can be attributed to their unconventional education. László believed in starting early, specializing in one subject, making practice into play, providing positive reinforcement, and fostering self-discipline and motivation. The family's approach to learning aligns with the principles of ultralearning, which include metalearning, focus, directness, drill, retrieval, feedback, retention, intuition, and experimentation.

The chapter concludes with the author discussing how to foster ultralearning in the home, school, and workplace. He suggests creating inspiring goals, being careful with competition to avoid discouragement, making learning a priority, and providing opportunities for individuals to tackle challenging projects of their own design. The author emphasizes the importance of developing a culture of continuous learning and providing opportunities for individuals to rise to difficult challenges, ultimately revealing their true talents.
