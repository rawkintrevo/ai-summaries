Chapter II of the book discusses the importance of ultralearning in today's society. It begins by referencing a book called "Average Is Over" by Tyler Cowen, which suggests that traditional jobs are becoming less available and that people need to become exceptional in order to succeed. This sets the stage for the concept of ultralearning, which is the ability to quickly acquire new skills and knowledge.

The chapter then refers to a study by MIT economist David Autor, who argues that there is a growing polarization in the labor market. High-skill, high-wage jobs are increasing, while low-skill, low-wage jobs are also growing. This further highlights the need for individuals to develop exceptional skills in order to secure well-paying jobs.

One of the factors contributing to the need for ultralearning is the rising cost of education. The chapter cites an article from The Washington Post that reports that tuition costs have been increasing at a much faster rate than financial aid. This means that students are increasingly burdened with debt and need to find alternative ways to gain the skills necessary to succeed in the job market.

The chapter also discusses the example of Terry Tao, a renowned mathematician who began exhibiting exceptional math skills at a young age. The author highlights Tao's ability to quickly grasp complex mathematical concepts and solve challenging problems. This demonstrates the power of ultralearning and how it can lead to extraordinary achievements.

The chapter goes on to explain the benefits of ultralearning. It argues that by becoming an ultralearner, individuals can have a higher level of control over their careers and lives. Ultralearning allows people to acquire the skills they need without relying on traditional education systems, which can be expensive and time-consuming.

The chapter also emphasizes the importance of continuous learning in today's rapidly changing world. It suggests that by adopting an ultralearning mindset, individuals can stay ahead of the curve and adapt to new challenges and opportunities. Ultralearning enables individuals to develop a growth mindset and embrace the process of learning, rather than being focused solely on the end result.

The chapter concludes by highlighting the personal and societal implications of ultralearning. It suggests that by becoming exceptional learners, individuals can not only improve their own lives but also contribute to the advancement of society as a whole. Ultralearners have the potential to solve complex problems, push the boundaries of knowledge, and make significant contributions in their fields.

Overall, Chapter II emphasizes the importance of ultralearning in today's society. It argues that traditional education models are no longer sufficient and that individuals need to develop exceptional skills in order to succeed. By adopting an ultralearning mindset, individuals can take control of their own learning, stay ahead of the curve, and make a positive impact on the world.
