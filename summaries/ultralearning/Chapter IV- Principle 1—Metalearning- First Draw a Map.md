In Chapter IV, the author introduces Principle 1 of metalearning, which is to "First Draw a Map." This principle emphasizes the importance of planning and understanding the path of learning before diving into it. The author provides various examples and references to support this principle.

The author begins by referencing a video titled "Monolingual Fieldwork Demonstration" by the Linguistic Society of America. The video showcases Daniel Everett, an linguist, communicating with a speaker of the Pirahã language, which is spoken by a remote community in the Amazon jungle of Brazil. To maintain the integrity of the demonstration, Everett chooses to phrase all his initial queries in Pirahã. This example highlights the importance of understanding the language and culture that one wants to study before engaging with it.

The author also mentions Dan Everett's claims about the grammar of Pirahã, which has sparked controversy in the field of linguistics. This leads to the understanding that studying a unique language like Pirahã requires deep knowledge and careful observation.

To further emphasize the importance of metalearning, the author cites a study by Jacqueline Thomas on the role of metalinguistic awareness in language learning. This study delves into the concept of reflecting on one's own language learning process and using that awareness to improve one's skills. Metalearning, in this context, involves being conscious of one's own learning strategies and adapting them as necessary.

The author then explores the idea of determining whether learning something will be useful and meaningful in the long run. They explain that this is particularly relevant when considering graduate school. The point is not to say that graduate school is a waste of time, but rather to encourage individuals to thoroughly research and assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of pursuing higher education.

As an example, the author references an article by Victor Mair titled "How to Learn Chinese and Japanese." Mair discusses the challenges and strategies for effectively learning these languages, emphasizing the importance of planning and setting achievable goals.

The author also mentions a study by George E. Spear and Donald W. Mocker on self-directed learning. This study explores the role of environmental factors in shaping individuals' ability to engage in self-directed learning. The author uses this study to highlight the influence of the learning environment on metalearning.

Finally, the author shares their personal experience with metalearning by referencing an online course on portrait drawing. They narrate how they initially struggled to find suitable resources for learning portrait drawing and eventually discovered a comprehensive online course that provided the structure and guidance they needed.

In conclusion, Chapter IV discusses Principle 1 of metalearning, which emphasizes the importance of planning and understanding before embarking on a learning journey. The author provides examples, references, and personal experiences to support this principle, highlighting the significance of language learning, research, self-directed learning, and goal setting in the metalearning process.
