In the spring of 1913, mathematician G. H. Hardy received a letter from an accounting clerk in India named Srinivasa Ramanujan. Ramanujan claimed to have discovered theorems that had yet to be solved by the greatest mathematical minds of the time. Hardy initially dismissed the letter, but upon further examination of Ramanujan's equations, he realized that they were indeed true and remarkable.

Ramanujan was a self-taught mathematician who had a special love for equations. Despite his lack of formal education and limited access to high-quality textbooks, he was able to derive his own solutions to mathematical problems. He relied heavily on a book called "A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics," which presented theorems without explanation or proof. Ramanujan would try to figure out the solutions himself, relying on his own powers of retrieval.

Studies have shown that retrieval practice, or trying to recall information from memory, is a more effective learning strategy than passive review or concept mapping. In one study, students were divided into four groups and given the same amount of time to study. The group that practiced free recall, or trying to remember information without looking at the text, outperformed the other groups on the final test.

However, many students do not realize the benefits of retrieval practice and prefer to stick to less effective study methods. This may be due to the fact that humans do not have the ability to accurately judge how well they have learned something. They rely on clues from their studying experience, such as how fluently they can process the material, to make judgments of learning. Immediately after studying, these judgments may be accurate, but test results show that retrieval practice leads to better long-term retention.

One possible explanation for students' preference for passive review over retrieval practice is that they do not feel confident enough in their knowledge to test themselves. However, research has shown that retrieval practice works better regardless of whether students feel "ready" or not. It is more efficient to practice retrieval earlier, even if you have to look up the answers.

The difficulty of retrieval is also a key factor in its effectiveness. More difficult retrieval, such as free recall without hints, leads to better learning. Delaying the first test of newly learned information can also improve retention, but waiting too long may result in forgetting the information entirely. Finding the right balance of difficulty is important.

Retrieval can also enhance future learning. Regular testing of previously studied information can make it easier to learn new information. This forward-testing effect may be due to the reinforcement of search strategies or the adjustment of attentional resources to spot relevant information.

There are several tactics that can be used to practice retrieval. Flash cards are a simple and effective way to learn paired associations between questions and answers. Free recall, or trying to write down everything you can remember, is another tactic that can be used. The question-book method involves taking notes as questions instead of answers, which prompts retrieval practice later. Self-generated challenges and closed-book learning can also be effective ways to practice retrieval.

In conclusion, retrieval practice is a powerful learning tool that is often overlooked by students. It is more effective than passive review or concept mapping and can enhance future learning. Using tactics such as flash cards, free recall, the question-book method, self-generated challenges, and closed-book learning can help incorporate retrieval practice into studying.
