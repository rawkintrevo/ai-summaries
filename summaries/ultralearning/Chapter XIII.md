In this chapter, the author discusses the steps to take in order to successfully complete an ultralearning project. The first step is to do research on the topic you want to learn and gather the necessary resources. This includes determining the scope of the project, identifying primary resources such as books and videos, finding benchmarks from successful learners, and identifying direct practice activities and backup materials. 

The next step is to schedule your time for the project. This involves determining how much time you can commit to learning, deciding when you will learn (e.g. in the morning, during lunch breaks), and setting a consistent schedule that is the same every week. The author suggests that shorter, spaced time chunks are better for memory retention, but some tasks may require longer uninterrupted time periods.

After scheduling your time, the next step is to execute your plan. The author acknowledges that no plan is perfect and that adjustments may need to be made along the way. He provides a list of questions to ask yourself to ensure that you are aligning with the principles of ultralearning, such as focusing on direct practice and retrieving information from memory.

Once the project is completed (or paused), the author recommends taking the time to review your results. This involves reflecting on what went right and what went wrong, and identifying any changes that could be made for future projects. The author emphasizes that not all projects will be successful, but that even the failures can provide valuable lessons.

The final step is to choose whether to maintain or master what you have learned. The author discusses options for maintaining skills, such as setting up habits of regular practice or integrating the skill into your life. Alternatively, you may choose to relearn the skill later when needed, as forgetting is inevitable. Finally, the author discusses the option of pursuing mastery by continuing to practice and learn or by embarking on another ultralearning project.

The chapter concludes with a discussion of alternative strategies to ultralearning, such as low-intensity habits and formal, structured education. The author explains that ultralearning is not the only approach to learning and that different strategies may be more suitable in certain contexts. The ultimate goal of ultralearning, according to the author, is to expand the opportunities for learning and to push oneself to pursue new avenues of knowledge.
