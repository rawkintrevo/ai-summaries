In Chapter 6 of the book, the author discusses the importance of understanding what success looks like in building and managing a community. The author begins by acknowledging the risks involved in community initiatives and the potential challenges that can arise, such as lack of interest, uninteresting results, and conflicts among community members. The author emphasizes the need to balance an understanding of these risks with a focus on the opportunities and potential impact of the community. 

To effectively measure success in a community, the author introduces the concept of measuring unambiguously. The author suggests that goals and metrics should be specific and measurable, rather than vague or subjective. The author warns against setting goals that are too ambiguous, as they can be easily misinterpreted and lead to excuses or misunderstandings. Instead, the author advises setting clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no" to measure the success of the community initiatives.

The author provides four rules for measuring effectively. The first rule is to test critical dimensions, which are the key areas in which the community's effectiveness can be measured. These dimensions include growth, retention, community engagement, company-community engagement, delivery, attendance, and efficiency. The second rule is to measure both action and validation, meaning that not only should the actions of community members be measured, but also the validation or quality of those actions. The third rule is to have clear "yes" or "no" answers when measuring progress, rather than leaving room for ambiguity. The fourth rule is to limit the number of metrics being measured to avoid overwhelming the team with unnecessary data.

The author then discusses the importance of having a strong foundation for a community. This foundation includes the Community Mission Statement, Community Engagement Models, Community Value Statement, Big Rocks, Community Participation Framework, and Quarterly Delivery Plan. The author emphasizes the need to stay on track with this foundation and regularly review and adjust the plan as needed. The author also introduces the concept of cadence-based cycles, which involve planning, executing, reviewing, and refining the community initiatives on a regular basis.

To assess the success of a community, the author suggests focusing on three key areas: productive participation, getting things done (delivery and execution), and organizational capabilities. For productive participation, the author introduces the concept of the Community Persona Maturity Model, which defines the stages of participation for different audience personas and helps measure their progress. For getting things done, the author explains the cadence-based cycle approach, where work is planned, executed, reviewed, and refined on a regular basis. For organizational capabilities, the author presents the Organizational Capabilities Maturity Model, which defines the stages of developing community-related skills and integrating them into the organization.

In conclusion, this chapter provides guidance on how to measure and assess the success of a community initiative. It emphasizes the need for specific and measurable goals, clear measurements of progress, and a strong foundation and regular review of the community plan. By following these guidelines, the author believes that communities can make progress, deliver value, and achieve success.
