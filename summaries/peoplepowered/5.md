In Chapter 5 of the book, the author shares a story about a company that invested a significant amount of money in building a community but did not see much return on their investment. The author identifies several issues with the community, including a lack of clarity, poor user experience, and a lack of incentives for participation. The author recommends that the company focus on creating a clear and engaging community experience by mapping out a journey for community members.

The author introduces the concept of a Community Participation Framework, which is a map that guides the community experience. The framework is divided into three sections: onboarding, engagement, and incentivization. The onboarding section focuses on helping new community members get started and produce something of value quickly and easily. The engagement section focuses on keeping members engaged and moving forward, while the incentivization section focuses on providing rewards and incentives to encourage ongoing participation.

The author explains that each section of the framework should be applied to each target audience persona individually. Different personas will have different needs and preferences, so it's important to tailor the community experience to each persona. The author provides examples of on-ramps for different personas, such as a support community for a streaming TV device and a developer community for a mobile platform.

The author emphasizes the importance of testing and iterating on the on-ramps to ensure they are effective. The on-ramps should be designed to be simple, intuitive, and efficient, and should lead community members from one step to the next in a clear and logical manner. The author also suggests measuring the completion of each step to identify any problem areas and make improvements.

In the engagement section, the author introduces the concept of the Casual, Regular, and Core segments of the community. Casual members are new to the community and may feel socially awkward or unsure of themselves. The goal with casual members is to help them acclimate to the community and build their confidence. Regular members are more established in the community and provide the foundation for ongoing participation. The author recommends finding ways to incorporate regular members into the broader structure and strategy of the community. Core members are the most committed and dedicated members of the community. The author suggests treating core members with respect and involving them in the leadership and decision-making of the community.

The author also discusses the importance of incentivization and rewards in driving participation and growth in the community. The author recommends incorporating incentives and rewards in the form of badges, achievements, and other rewards to keep members engaged and motivated.

Finally, the author introduces the concept of a Quarterly Delivery Plan, which is a document that outlines the specific goals and deliverables for each quarter. The plan helps to track progress and hold team members accountable for their work.

Overall, Chapter 5 provides a blueprint for creating an engaging and successful community by focusing on a clear and intuitive onboarding process, creating opportunities for engagement and growth, and providing incentives and rewards to encourage ongoing participation. The author emphasizes the importance of testing, iterating, and adapting the community experience to the specific needs and preferences of each target audience persona.
