In this chapter, the author discusses the importance of building value in a community strategy. They start by sharing a story about someone who organized an event, but no one showed up because they didn't understand the value the event offered to attendees. The author argues that simply putting together the venue, advertising, and other logistics is not enough - value requires understanding what your audience wants and how you can deliver it to them. 

The author then defines value as something of relative worth, utility, or importance, and breaks it down into two types: tangible value and intangible value. Tangible value refers to measurable, physical goods and services, while intangible value refers to the benefits and experiences that people feel. The author explains that humans are wired to invest their time and effort where they see value, so it is important to understand and articulate the value that can be generated in a community. 

To determine the value that should be generated, the author suggests creating a value statement. They recommend dividing a piece of paper in half and brainstorming the value for the organization and for the community members. The value for community members should be the focus, as putting their success and value first will naturally lead to success for the organization. The author advises putting yourself in the shoes of prospective members and considering what they care about and the problems they want to solve. They then provide examples of common areas of value in different communities, such as meeting other people, accessing interesting content, receiving high-quality education and help, developing skills, and receiving mentoring and coaching. 

The author also emphasizes the importance of value for the organization. They explain that communities require investment, time, and consistent nurturing, so it is important to be clear on what the organization wants to accomplish. Examples of value for the organization include customer and user growth, better support for customers and users, improved marketing and brand recognition, technology/product production and enhancement, and recruiting and services. The author cautions against being self-serving or using the community for spamming sales material, instead emphasizing the need to focus on value that is compatible with the interests of community members. 

After determining the value for the organization and community members, the author discusses the importance of setting clear objectives called Big Rocks. These objectives should be ambitious and move the needle, but also realistic and doable. The author recommends brainstorming five to seven key objectives for the community strategy over the next year, and using a specific format to document each objective, including a single line summary, key initiatives, key performance indicators (KPIs), and owner. They provide examples of Big Rocks from different clients. 

The author acknowledges that value costs time and money to create, and there will be roadblocks and unforeseen challenges. They advise planning for buffer time and staying flexible in the face of unexpected curveballs. Finally, the author emphasizes the importance of keeping the Community Value Statement front and center and integrating it into the way work is done. Regularly asking if something will help shape the value desired is key to success.
