Chapter 10 of the book focuses on integrating, evolving, and building a community strategy within an organization. The author emphasizes that a strong plan means nothing if it cannot be put into action. In order to successfully execute a community strategy, it is important to hire the right community management staff.

The chapter begins by outlining the three main roles within community management: Community Director, Community Manager, and Community Evangelist. The Community Director is the most senior role and is responsible for understanding business requirements, building a strategy, and engaging with the community. The Community Manager is less senior but focuses on executing the strategy and managing relationships with community members. The Community Evangelist is responsible for delivering information and knowledge to the community and beyond.

When hiring community management staff, the author recommends prioritizing finding a people person who is willing to grow. While a candidate should ideally possess domain expertise, it is more important that they have a passion and interest in the community's focus. It is also important to assess their willingness to learn and grow, as community strategy is constantly evolving.

The chapter then provides advice on where to find community management staff. The author suggests reaching out to other leaders who have hired similar roles in other communities for guidance. It is important to promote the role and source candidates effectively, avoiding the use of recruiters who may not understand the nuances of community management. Two primary ways to find candidates are hiring away from their current roles or mentoring existing staff into community management.

Next, the chapter discusses where community management roles should report in within an organization. The author mentions that the role should ideally report to the CEO or a founder, as community should be a critical component of the organization. Reporting into marketing, engineering, or product are also possible options depending on the nature of the community. Regardless of where the role reports in, it is crucial to ensure alignment between departments and a clear understanding of responsibilities.

The chapter then delves into integrating the community strategy into the business. It emphasizes the importance of making community everyone's priority, with leadership demonstrating good community habits and expecting their teams to participate. Additionally, departmental alignment is crucial to ensure that all departments understand their roles in delivering the community strategy.

To facilitate alignment and execution, the author recommends operating on a cadence cycle, which includes cycle planning, weekly syncs, quarterly reviews, and cycle reviews. This cycle provides an opportunity for different stakeholders to provide input, unblock problems, review delivery, and identify areas for improvement.

Training and mentoring are also highlighted as essential components of integrating the community strategy. It is important to provide education on the importance of community and specific goals for employees to accomplish. Mentoring programs should be put in place to provide guidance and support to employees as they engage with the community.

Lastly, the chapter emphasizes the need to execute, review, and repeat. It is acknowledged that not everything will go according to plan, but it is important to learn from both successes and failures. Problems should be seen as opportunities for improvement, and successes should be celebrated.

Overall, the chapter provides practical advice and strategies for integrating and evolving a community strategy within an organization. It emphasizes the importance of hiring the right staff, aligning departments, operating on a cadence cycle, and providing training and mentoring. It emphasizes that perfection is not required, but a focus on continuous improvement is essential.
