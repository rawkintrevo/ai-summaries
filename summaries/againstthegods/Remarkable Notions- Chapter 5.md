Sampling is an essential tool in making critical decisions based on limited data. It allows us to make inferences about a larger population based on a smaller sample. This concept is used in various fields, such as medicine, finance, and public opinion research. 

One of the earliest uses of sampling was in the King of England's Trial of the Pyx in 1279. This was a ceremony to ensure that the coinage minted by the Royal Mint met the standards of gold or silver content. Coins were randomly selected from the output of the Mint and compared to a plate of the King's gold. This procedure recognized that not every coin could be expected to match precisely the standard gold.

Another significant use of sampling was by John Graunt, who published Natural and Political Observations made upon the Bills of Mortality in 1662. Graunt compiled data on births and deaths in London from 1604 to 1661, along with an extended commentary interpreting the data. This book was a breakthrough in statistical and sociological research, as it used sampling methods and the calculation of probabilities. Graunt's work laid the foundation for the science of statistics.

Graunt's book went through several editions and attracted attention outside of England as well. His achievements led to his proposal for membership in the Royal Society, which was initially met with resistance due to his background as a tradesman. However, he was eventually admitted, and the Royal Society became one of the most distinguished scientific academies of the time.

Graunt's analysis of the Bills of Mortality allowed him to estimate the population of London and provide insights into various demographic aspects. He also introduced the concept of life tables, which showed the probability of survival at different ages. This information was used to calculate the value of annuities and insurance policies.

Another important figure in the history of sampling is Edmund Halley, an astronomer and mathematician who was familiar with Graunt's work. Halley used data from the town of Breslaw in Germany to estimate the town's population and create an age distribution table. He also calculated the odds of survival at different ages, which could be used for insurance and annuity calculations.

The development of the insurance industry was closely intertwined with the use of sampling. Lloyd's of London, the most famous insurance company, was founded in a coffee house by Edward Lloyd in 1687. The coffee house became a gathering place for merchants and underwriters who would cover various risks, such as marine and fire insurance. The growth of insurance and the need for forecasting in business led to innovations in risk management and the use of statistics.

Overall, sampling has played a crucial role in decision-making throughout history. It allows us to make educated guesses about the future based on limited data. The use of sampling has evolved over time and has shaped various fields of study, including statistics, insurance, and finance.
