In this chapter, the author discusses the measurement of risk in investment portfolios. The concept of risk has evolved over time and has been quantified to some extent by professionals in the investing industry. Historically, risk was seen as a subjective and intuitive concept, with aggressive investors seeking higher returns and conservative investors preferring safer options. However, in 1952, Harry Markowitz published a groundbreaking article titled "Portfolio Selection," which introduced the idea of quantifying risk through the use of mathematical models. Markowitz's work revolutionized the field of investment management and earned him a Nobel Prize in 1990.

Markowitz's approach to measuring risk involves considering the variance of returns as the undesirable aspect of investing. He argued that diversification is the best tool to minimize risk and maximize return. By combining assets with different levels of risk and volatility, investors can create portfolios that achieve higher returns while reducing overall risk. Markowitz's framework, known as mean-variance optimization, uses expected return and variance as the primary factors in portfolio construction.

The author also acknowledges that there have been criticisms of Markowitz's work. Some question the assumption of investor rationality in decision-making and the use of variance as a proxy for risk. However, the author argues that Markowitz's methods still hold value, even if risk is defined differently or if investors have different preferences. The key is to take into account an investor's specific objectives and benchmarks when measuring risk and constructing portfolios.

The chapter also discusses the practical challenges of implementing Markowitz's ideas. Gathering accurate data on expected returns, variances, and covariances can be difficult, and the results are highly sensitive to small differences in these inputs. Additionally, the assumption of normal distribution and stationary parameters may not always hold true in reality.

Furthermore, the author explores the relationship between risk and volatility. While volatility often serves as a good proxy for risk, it is not always the case. Risk can be defined as the chance of losing money or falling short of a benchmark, and this benchmark can vary depending on an investor's specific circumstances and objectives. The author also highlights the role of wealth and changes in wealth in influencing an investor's risk appetite.

Overall, the chapter explains the significance of Markowitz's work in revolutionizing the field of investment management and the measurement of risk. While there have been criticisms and challenges in implementing his ideas, Markowitz's framework continues to be widely used and has paved the way for further advancements in the field.
