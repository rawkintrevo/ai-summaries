In the 17th century, mathematicians Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat made significant contributions to the development of probability theory. Pascal, known for his work in mathematics and philosophy, had a strong interest in probability and its applications. Fermat, a lawyer by profession, also had a keen interest in mathematics and made important contributions in various fields, including number theory.

Pascal and Fermat's work on probability theory began with a question posed by the Chevalier de Méré, a nobleman with a passion for mathematics and gambling. De Méré was curious about the division of stakes in an unfinished game of balla, and Pascal and Fermat set out to find a solution.

Unlike earlier mathematicians who relied on intuition and subjective beliefs, Pascal and Fermat approached probability analysis in a more systematic and rigorous manner. They developed a theory of probability that involved calculating the likelihood of different outcomes based on hard numbers and mathematical calculations, rather than degrees of belief.

One of the key tools they used in their analysis was Pascal's Triangle, a triangular arrangement of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two numbers above it. This allowed them to enumerate the number of different outcomes and calculate the probabilities associated with each outcome.

Using Pascal's Triangle, they were able to solve the problem of the points in the unfinished game of balla. They determined the probability of a player winning the game based on the number of games remaining and the current score. This involved calculating the different possible sequences of wins and losses, and their respective probabilities.

Through their work, Pascal and Fermat laid the foundation for modern probability theory and its applications in various fields, including insurance and risk management. Their work provided a systematic and mathematical approach to analyzing the likelihood of future events and making informed decisions based on that analysis.

Pascal's work in probability theory was part of a larger shift towards a more mathematical and rigorous approach to scientific inquiry. He was also involved in other areas of mathematics, including geometry and algebra. However, his religious convictions ultimately came to dominate his life, and he devoted much of his later years to religious studies and writing.

Despite his religious focus, Pascal's contributions to mathematics and probability theory remain significant. His work on probability paved the way for further developments in the field and provided a solid foundation for the study of risk and uncertainty. His ideas continue to be relevant in the modern era, where risk management and decision-making under uncertainty are essential components of many fields and industries.
