Parliamentary Requirements of Conventions

The article discusses the parliamentary requirements that need to be followed during conventions. After the opening ceremonies of a convention, there are three required procedures that must be followed.

The first procedure is the adoption of the report of the Credentials Committee. The Credentials Committee is responsible for determining the number of voting members present through registration. The number of voting members registered determines whether a quorum is present. A quorum is defined as the minimum number of members that must be present to legally transact business. The credentials report must be given first, even if delegates are still registering. An incomplete credentials report is called a preliminary report, and the complete report is given at a later time when registration is complete. The credentials report must be adopted, either by a motion made by the chairman or by general consent. After the report is adopted, the presiding officer declares a quorum present and the meeting to be in official session.

The second procedure is the adoption of the Convention Rules. Special rules are usually necessary to limit the length and number of speeches allowed delegates, the length of reports, and so on due to the size of the meeting and the amount of business to be conducted. The chairman of the Rules Committee presents the rules and moves for their adoption. No second is required for this motion as it comes from a committee. A two-thirds vote, which is a rising vote, is required due to the limitation of the rights of members. The Chair then declares that the rules are adopted.

The third procedure is the adoption of the Agenda/Program. The Chair may use general consent to adopt the program. If there is no objection, the program will be adopted as printed. The delegates have the right to offer amendments at the time each of these motions is presented for action. The credentials report may be amended to seat additional delegates. The rules may be amended to be either more restrictive or more liberal. The program may be amended to change the order of business.

The article also provides sample rules for a convention or annual meeting. These rules are designed to expedite business and ensure that each member has the privilege of the floor while protecting the right of the organization to accomplish its business. Some of the sample rules include requiring members and guests to register and display identification badges before being admitted to the business session, limiting oral reports by committee chairmen to five minutes, and requiring all motions to be written, signed, and sent immediately to the recording secretary.

Finally, the article suggests a convention agenda that can be followed. The agenda includes items such as registration, opening ceremonies, introductions, credentials report, convention rules, convention program, elections, reports of officers, reports of standing committees, and new business. The agenda ends with adjournment sine die, which means "without day," or never to meet again as each convention will have a different membership with the election of different delegates.

In conclusion, parliamentary requirements play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth functioning of conventions. The adoption of the report of the Credentials Committee, the adoption of the Convention Rules, and the adoption of the Agenda/Program are all essential procedures that must be followed. Additionally, special rules can be adopted to expedite business and protect the rights of members. A well-structured agenda can also help guide the flow of the convention. By following these parliamentary requirements, conventions can effectively conduct business and make decisions.
