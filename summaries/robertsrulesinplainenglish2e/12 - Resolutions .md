A resolution is a written document that is used to express the policy, principles, or sentiments of an organization in a formal manner. It is essentially a main motion that is submitted in writing. Resolutions are often used when an organization wants to make an official statement or position on a matter.

A resolution consists of two main parts: the preamble and the resolved clause. The preamble starts with the word "Whereas" and provides the reasons and background information for the resolution. It should be kept concise and only include relevant information that strengthens the resolution. The resolved clause starts with the word "RESOLVED" and contains the specific motion or action to be adopted by the organization.

When drafting a resolution, it is important to keep it brief and well-written. A long and wordy resolution is less effective than a concise and clear one. The use of a preamble is not required by parliamentary procedure and should not be used for the sake of formality alone.

Here is an example of a resolution:

Whereas,

The use of parliamentary procedure safeguards the democratic process; and

Whereas,

Parliamentary procedure is complex; therefore, be it

RESOLVED,

That the Green Acres Association purchase copies of Robert's Rules in Plain English, Second Edition, for all of the officers.

In terms of punctuation, each clause in the resolution should be written as a separate paragraph and punctuated with a semicolon. The only period appears at the end of the resolution, regardless of the length. The beginning word of each clause in the preamble and "That" in the resolved clause should be capitalized.

In terms of taking action on a resolution, the resolved clause is stated by the presiding officer and acted upon first. The resolves are handled like any other main motion and can be open to amendment. Once the resolves are adopted, the preamble is presented. The reason for presenting the preamble last is that any amendment to the resolves may require an amendment to the preamble as well.

Here is an example of how a resolution is acted upon:

"The resolution, resolved, that the Green Acres Association purchase copies of Robert's Rules in Plain English, Second Edition, for all of the officers is on the floor. Is there any discussion?"

Mr. P rises and proposes an amendment to the resolution by striking out the words "for all of the officers" and inserting "for the president."

The president states the amendment and takes a vote. If the amendment is defeated, the resolution is adopted as originally presented.

Overall, resolutions are a formal way for organizations to express their policy, principles, or sentiments. They consist of a preamble and a resolved clause, with the resolved clause being acted upon first. Resolutions should be well-written, concise, and use proper punctuation.
