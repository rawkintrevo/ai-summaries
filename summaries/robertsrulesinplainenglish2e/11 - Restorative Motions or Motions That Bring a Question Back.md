Restorative motions are a specific category of parliamentary motions that allow a group to change its mind on a previously decided question. They are called restorative motions because they restore a previously decided question back onto the floor for further discussion and decision-making. Restorative motions are in contradiction to the general parliamentary rule that once a question has been decided, it cannot be brought up again during the same meeting.

There are two commonly used restorative motions: rescind and reconsider.

Rescind is the motion used to nullify or quash a previously adopted motion. It has the power to strike out an entire motion, resolution, bylaw, or any other decision made by the group. However, there are special rules for the use of this motion. First, it is not in order when any action has already been taken as a result of the vote that is being rescinded, such as entering into a contract where the other party has already been notified. Rescind must be seconded by another member, and it requires a two-thirds vote, unless notice has been given at the previous meeting, either verbally or in writing. In this case, the motion only requires a majority vote for adoption.

Here is an example of the use of the rescind motion:

A member proposes the motion to rescind a previously adopted motion regarding the construction of a playground due to the financial impact on the Green Acres Association. The chair of the meeting reminds the members of the special rules for the rescind motion. As no contracts have been let for the playground, the motion is deemed in order. The motion to rescind requires a second, is open to debate, and requires a two-thirds vote for adoption. After the debate and voting, if the motion to rescind is lost, the original motion to construct the playground stands as the will of the group.

Reconsider is another restorative motion that allows a group to reconsider the vote on a motion that has already been decided. This motion is strictly an American motion and has specific rules to prevent its abuse. Reconsider can only be made by someone who voted on the winning side (the prevailing side) of the original vote. It must also be made on the same day that the original vote was taken, or in a convention, it can be made on the next succeeding calendar day, but no later. Reconsider must be seconded and may be debated. It opens up the original motion to debate as well. Reconsider requires only a majority vote for adoption. It can be made and seconded while other business is pending, but it is not debated or voted on until the current business on the floor is completed. The main value of the reconsider motion is that all action that might have come out of the original motion is stopped once reconsider is made and seconded.

Here is an example of the use of the reconsider motion:

The chair informs the group that a member has made a motion to reconsider the vote on asking Creative Playgrounds to present a proposal with cost estimates for the construction of a playground. The chair states that, according to the parliamentary authority (Robert's Rules), the motion is only in order if made on the same day as the original vote or the next succeeding calendar day in a convention. The chair also notes that the motion must be made by someone who voted on the winning side. The member is asked how they voted, and if it was on the winning side, the motion is deemed in order. The motion to reconsider is seconded, and open for discussion. After the discussion, a vote is taken. If the vote is in favor of reconsidering the original motion, it is brought back onto the floor for further amendments, committee referrals, or postponements before a final vote is taken once again.

In summary, restorative motions, such as rescind and reconsider, allow a group to change its mind on a previously decided question. Rescind nullifies a previously adopted motion, while reconsider reopens the vote on a motion that has already been decided. These motions have specific rules and requirements to prevent abuse and ensure fair and thoughtful decision-making.
