The content provided explains the process of organizing and running a conference call. It states that all states recognize a duly-called meeting for a conference call with a quorum present as a valid meeting. The conference call allows all members to hear and participate in the business to be conducted.

The first step in organizing a conference call is to develop rules for the conduct of the meeting. This ensures that the meeting is conducted in an orderly manner. It is also important to develop a conference call checklist to ensure that all telephone numbers are current. Additionally, a detailed meeting agenda should be sent to all members ahead of time, outlining the business to be considered and the order in which it will be discussed. A meeting minutes form should be prepared to accurately record the actions agreed upon during the call. It is also suggested to develop a feedback form that can be emailed to the participants, allowing them to review their impression of the meeting. Lastly, a ratification form should be prepared for members to sign and return, either by fax or mail, to validate the actions taken during the conference call.

During the call, it is important to start with a roll call to ensure that all participants are connected. The rules of the meeting should be reviewed, including requirements for members to identify themselves and request permission from the chairman before speaking. There may also be limits on the duration and number of times a member can speak. New members should be introduced to familiarize everyone with each other. When opening discussions, the question should be clearly stated. It is important to keep track of who is talking and call on those members who have not yet spoken. The vote should be verified by calling each member's name and asking how they wish to vote. The call should be ended clearly, ensuring that all members know the meeting is adjourned.

Conference call etiquette should also be followed. Participants should be on time for the call and take it in a quiet location to avoid distractions. It is recommended to use a hardwired phone if possible, as cellular phones and speakerphones tend to pick up ambient noise. Call waiting should be turned off to avoid interruptions. Participants should state their names before speaking as required by the rules. Respect should be given to the time limits set for debate, and participants should not put the phone on hold to perform other tasks.

Validating the actions taken during the conference call is important. Each member should sign a written consent, or ratification, for the actions taken. This ratification can then be confirmed at the next face-to-face meeting.

The content also explains that the bylaws of the organization should contain a statement permitting teleconferencing under the "Meetings" section. This statement allows for the use of conference calls for directors' or committees' meetings. The bylaws should also state that signatures transmitted by fax shall be deemed valid.

A caution is given regarding telephone polling. It is emphasized that calling members of a board or committee and polling them regarding action to be taken does not meet the requirements for a meeting in any state. Group deliberation is an essential element that should occur in a regular meeting where ideas are exchanged.

Overall, the content provides a comprehensive guide on how to organize and run a conference call effectively. It covers the necessary preparations, etiquette, and validation of actions taken during the call. It also highlights the importance of following parliamentary requirements and the potential pitfalls of telephone polling.
