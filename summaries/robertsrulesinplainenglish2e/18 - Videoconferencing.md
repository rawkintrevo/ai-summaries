Videoconferencing is a method of communication that allows members to see each other on a computer screen and hear each other through their computer speakers. There are two main types of videoconferencing: permanent presence and voice-activated. Permanent presence displays images of all the participants at all times, although the quality may not be clear. Voice-activated displays only the face of the person speaking, resulting in a clearer picture but missing the reactions of other group members.

To organize a videoconference, it is important to develop rules for the conduct of the meeting, prepare a detailed agenda, and attach any relevant reports or background information. The time of the meeting should be established, taking into account multiple time zones if necessary. Additionally, it is advisable to prepare a list of contact numbers in case there are issues with the connections during the videoconference. Developing a "minutes form" to record the actions agreed upon and a "ratification form" for members to sign and record their votes is also recommended.

During the videoconference, it is recommended to open the meeting with a roll call to ensure that all participants can hear and see each other. Each member should introduce themselves to confirm that they can be seen and heard. The planned agenda should be reviewed, and the rules of the meeting, such as how members obtain recognition and the floor, should be reiterated. It is important to leave longer pauses when recognizing members due to the time lag in transmission. Addressing members by name and clearly stating the question for discussion is recommended. To verify votes, each member's name should be called. Lastly, clearly adjourn the meeting when it is concluded.

There are certain etiquette guidelines that should be followed during a videoconference. It is important to speak clearly and more slowly than usual to ensure everyone can understand. Excessive body movements should be avoided, and participants should dress in muted colors, avoiding loud patterns. Using the mute button when shuffling papers or coughing is courteous to other participants.

There are also parliamentary requirements that need to be considered when utilizing videoconferencing. The bylaws of the organization should contain a statement permitting videoconferencing in the meetings section. For example, a statement could say "Meetings of the directors or committees may be held by videoconferencing provided that all members participating can see and hear each other simultaneously." Additionally, the bylaws should state that signatures transmitted by facsimile transmission (fax) are considered valid.

In summary, videoconferencing is a valuable tool for communication, allowing members to interact visually and audibly through a computer screen. To organize a videoconference, it is important to establish rules, prepare a detailed agenda, and have backup contact numbers. During the videoconference, it is necessary to ensure all participants can be seen and heard, follow the agenda, and adhere to proper parliamentary etiquette. The bylaws of the organization should have provisions for videoconferencing and recognize the validity of signatures transmitted by fax. Overall, videoconferencing can enhance communication and collaboration among group members, regardless of geographical location.
