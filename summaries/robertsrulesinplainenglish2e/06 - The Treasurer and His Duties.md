This document discusses the role and responsibilities of a treasurer in an organization. The treasurer is responsible for handling the funds of the organization, including receiving and disbursing money according to the organization's bylaws and the instructions of the members. The treasurer also typically handles billing and collecting annual dues.

In addition to managing the organization's finances, the treasurer is responsible for maintaining a detailed record book that tracks all money received and paid out. Any corrections should be clearly indicated in red and never erased. The treasurer is also responsible for ensuring the organization complies with any federal, state, or local taxes and for filing the necessary tax forms in a timely manner.

The treasurer is expected to give a brief report at each meeting, summarizing the collections and expenditures and noting any unusual items. The treasurer's report is not adopted, but the presiding officer should allow questions before stating that the report will be filed for audit. The annual auditor's report, which checks and verifies the accuracy of the treasurer's books, is voted on by the members.

The treasurer's books should be audited annually before the treasurer presents the annual report. If the organization cannot afford to hire an auditing firm, a committee of members can be appointed to review the books. A notation should be made in the ledger to indicate that the books have been audited.

The audit committee prepares an audit report that reflects their findings and recommendations. If no irregularities or errors are found, the report states that the books were audited and found to be correct. The report is dated and signed by the chairman and all members of the committee.

The treasurer may also be responsible for preparing a budget, which is an itemized summary of anticipated income and expenses for the upcoming fiscal or administrative year. The budget is prepared based on past experience and data recorded in the financial records. The bylaws specify whether the budget is adopted by the executive board or the membership, and it is usually adopted at the annual meeting. The budget can be amended at that time, but any later amendments require a two-thirds vote or previous notice and a majority vote.

It is generally recommended that organizations maintain a separate investment fund that is equal to six months of the operating budget.

The document also includes a sample form for a treasurer's report, demonstrating how to format and present the information about the organization's receipts and disbursements. The report includes a balance on hand, details about dues and donations received, and information about various expenditures. The report concludes with the balance on hand at the time of the report.

Lastly, the document briefly mentions motions and their use, but provides no further information on this topic.
