E-mail is a widely used and productive tool of Internet service that allows for convenient, efficient, and economical communication. It is the most popular form of communication on the Internet, with tens of millions of messages being sent every day.

In organizations, e-mail is particularly useful for the rapid dissemination of information and the economic use of office staff and supplies. One of its best uses in a parliamentary context is to facilitate board meetings. Notices of meetings, minutes, and background information can be sent via email to all members who have email addresses. However, regular mail should be used for members without email.

There are some limitations to using email for meetings. Simultaneous communication, which is essential to the deliberative nature of meetings, is not possible with email. Therefore, e-mail meetings are not considered valid meetings in most states. Robert's Rules of Order, a popular guide to parliamentary procedure, also recommends against using email for meeting purposes.

Chat rooms, on the other hand, are a form of instant messaging that allow people to get together in cyberspace and discuss common interests. They are different from email in that the messages are transmitted almost instantly and participants can type responses immediately. Chat rooms can be useful for small informational meetings with members who have the technological know-how to participate. However, they should not be used for complex or sensitive issues that require extensive negotiation. Additionally, a legal vote cannot be determined in a chat room.

An example of an electronic meeting is provided involving the Green Acres Association. The association's swimming pool has suffered severe structural damage, and three out of five members of the executive committee are on vacation. The president of the association decides to hold an electronic meeting to address the issue. He emails the absent members a detailed description of the problem, attaches estimates for the repairs, and schedules a tentative date and time for a conference call.

Before the conference call, the chairman checks all the telephone numbers to ensure accuracy, develops a detailed agenda and rules for the meeting, and prepares forms for minutes and ratification. During the conference call, the members discuss the problem and decide on the best course of action. They also agree to mail ratification forms to each member for their signatures.

The example demonstrates how electronic meetings can be effectively conducted with the use of email and conference calls. With the advancements in technology, the feasibility of true electronic meetings will likely increase. However, it is important to consider the parliamentary and legal requirements for a meeting when using new technologies.

In conclusion, e-mail is a convenient and efficient tool for communication, and it is widely used in organizations for the dissemination of information. While it can be used for board meetings, it is important to note that e-mail meetings are not considered valid in most states. Chat rooms, on the other hand, are useful for small informational meetings but should not be used for complex or sensitive issues. As technology continues to advance, the feasibility of electronic meetings will increase, but it is essential to consider the requirements and limitations of these technologies in a parliamentary context.
