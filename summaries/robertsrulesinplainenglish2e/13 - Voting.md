The content provided in the text is focused on voting and the different types and methods of voting. The text explains that voting is the means by which an individual member expresses a choice in a group, and the result of the vote determines the action that the group will take.

The text first discusses the different types of votes that can occur. A majority vote is described as more than half of the votes cast, and it is the basic requirement for approval of an action or choice, unless a higher vote is specified in the rules. An example is given where there are 30 votes cast, with 16 in favor and 14 opposed, resulting in the motion being adopted.

A two-thirds vote is described as having at least twice as many votes on the winning side as on the losing side. It is noted that a vote of one-third plus one can defeat a proposition. An example is given where there are 30 votes cast, with 21 in favor and 9 opposed, resulting in the motion being adopted. A quick way to determine if a motion requiring a two-thirds vote has carried is to multiply the negative vote by two, and if this number is less than or equal to the number of affirmative votes, the motion is adopted.

A plurality vote is described as the largest number of votes given to any candidate or proposition when there are three or more choices. An example is given where there are 30 votes cast for three candidates, with Mr. A receiving 13 votes, Mr. B receiving 12 votes, and Mr. C receiving 5 votes. Mr. A is elected, even though he did not receive a majority. It is noted that a plurality vote never decides an election unless the bylaws specify that "a plurality shall elect."

The text then goes on to explain the different methods of voting. Voice voting is described as the usual method of voting when the motion does not require more than a majority. The Chair calls for the affirmative vote first, and then calls for the negative vote. The Chair makes the decision regarding the vote by what they hear. If the results are uncertain, a second vote may be taken with a rising vote or a show of hands. An example is given where the Chair is in doubt, and asks those in favor to rise and then asks those opposed to rise.

Rising vote or show of hands is described as a method of voting used for motions requiring a two-thirds vote, as a voice vote cannot accurately determine a two-thirds vote. The Chair informs the group if a motion requires a two-thirds vote. An example is given where the Chair asks those in favor to rise, and then asks those opposed to rise.

Verifying a rising vote is described as a way for the Chair to determine an inconclusive rising vote. Any member may move that the vote be counted, and this motion requires a second and a majority to adopt. An example is given where the Chair announces that a counted rising vote will be taken, and instructions are given for members to rise, count off, and then be seated.

Ballot voting is described as each voter writing their choice on a piece of paper. It is primarily used to protect the voters' right to secrecy. Ballot voting is used only if specified in the bylaws or ordered by the group. The Chair appoints "tellers" to distribute, collect, and count the ballots. An example is given where the Chair appoints tellers and gives instructions for marking the ballot. A recess may be called while the tellers count, and the Chair announces the result of the vote.

Abstentions are noted as not being counted in any method of voting. Only the number of votes cast is counted in determining a majority or two-thirds vote unless specified otherwise in the bylaws.

General consent is described as an informal agreement of the group, where action is taken without a formal vote. The Chair initiates the procedure, and general consent is a valuable technique in expediting business.

The text also briefly mentions tie votes, proxy votes, mail votes, and electronic voting, explaining that tie votes can be considered a lost vote and the Chair does not have to break a tie, proxy voting is not allowed in most organizations, mail voting is only permitted if stated in the bylaws, and electronic voting is only used by large organizations with the means to acquire an electronic system.
