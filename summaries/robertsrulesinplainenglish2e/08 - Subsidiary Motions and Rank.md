In parliamentary procedure, subsidiary motions are arranged in a specific order or rank. This order determines which motion takes precedence over others and must be considered and acted upon first. The purpose of this ranking is to avoid confusion when applying these motions to a main motion.

Rank means that a motion of higher rank can be made while a motion of lower rank is on the floor or pending. A motion of higher rank takes precedence over a motion of lower rank. For example, the motion to commit takes precedence over the motion to amend. This is because it would be a waste of time to discuss an amendment to a motion if the group may decide to send that motion to a committee for study.

It is important to note that more than one motion can be on the floor at the same time, but only one question can be considered. All pending motions must relate to the main motion on the floor, and no new business may be introduced.

Subsidiary motions can be understood by imagining them as rungs on a stepladder. The lower rungs must yield to the motions on the rung or rungs above. For example, the motion for the previous question, which calls for an immediate vote, is near the top rung of the ladder and takes precedence over all motions below it.

The most frequently used subsidiary motion is amend. To amend a motion means to change its wording to make it clearer, more complete, or more acceptable before it is voted upon. There are three ways to amend a motion: adding words or phrases, striking out words or phrases, or substituting an entire motion or paragraph. An amendment must be germane, meaning it must relate to the pending motion. No new business can be introduced under the pretext of an amendment.

Another commonly misunderstood concept is that there can be only one motion on the floor at a time. In reality, there can be more than one motion on the floor as long as they all relate to the main motion and no new business is introduced.

The amendment process allows the group to change the proposed motion to better represent the will of the group. However, adopting an amendment does not mean adopting the motion itself. The group can still further amend the motion or vote it down.

An amendment may also be amended, with the first amendment being called a primary amendment and the amendment to the amendment being called a secondary amendment. Only two amendments can be pending at any one time, as having more can lead to confusion.

A motion may also be amended by substituting an entirely new motion for the one on the floor, as long as it is germane. This can be useful in offering a compromise to an unacceptable motion.

Two commonly misused motions are postpone indefinitely and lay on the table. Postpone indefinitely is a motion to kill a main motion without a direct vote on the question. It is often used as a courtesy motion to test the strength of a motion that a faction opposes. Lay on the table, on the other hand, is a motion to set aside a question for something more important, such as the arrival of a speaker. It cannot be used to kill or avoid dealing with a measure and is commonly misused in this regard.
