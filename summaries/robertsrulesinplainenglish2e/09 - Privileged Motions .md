Privileged motions are a category of motions in parliamentary procedure that are not directly related to the current business on the floor, but instead relate to the rights of members and the organization as a whole. These motions are considered so important that they have the right to interrupt the current business being discussed. Privileged motions also have a hierarchy of rank among themselves, with some taking precedence over others.

The lowest ranked privileged motion is the question of privilege. This motion allows a member to interrupt the current business on the floor in order to state an urgent request related to the comfort, dignity, safety, or reputation of the organization or any individual member. There are two forms of privilege: general privilege, which affects the organization as a whole, and personal privilege, which affects individual members. Examples of general privilege include situations where the speaker cannot be heard or where some members did not receive a printed resolution. An example of personal privilege is when a speaker is misstating someone's remarks. It is up to the Chair to determine whether a question of privilege is important enough to interrupt the current business, and a member cannot claim privilege and make a speech. If a question of privilege is raised when no business is pending, it may be debated and amended, but the speaker who was interrupted retains the floor once the question of privilege is settled.

The next ranked privileged motion is recess. This motion proposes a short intermission in the meeting, temporarily suspending the current business. The motion should state the length of the recess or the time for reconvening. The purpose of the recess could be for lunch, counting ballots, or similar matters. The motion to recess must be seconded, but it cannot be debated. It can be amended, but only as to the length or time of the recess. Finally, it requires a majority vote to pass. Once the recess is over, the meeting resumes at the same point where it left off.

The highest ranked privileged motion is adjourn. This motion is made to close the meeting entirely. It can be made even when there is business pending, as long as the rules of the organization provide for another meeting. If the motion to adjourn is adopted, the unfinished business is carried over to the next meeting. The motion to adjourn must be seconded and cannot be debated or amended. It also requires a majority vote to pass. However, it is important to note that the motion to adjourn is out of order when a member has the floor, meaning they are speaking or engaged in some parliamentary action.

In summary, privileged motions are motions that pertain to the rights of members and the organization as a whole. They have the right to interrupt the current business and have a rank of importance among themselves. The lowest ranked privileged motion is the question of privilege, followed by the motion to recess, and finally the motion to adjourn, which is the highest ranked. These motions have specific rules regarding their seconding, debate, amendment, and voting requirements. Understanding and properly utilizing privileged motions can help ensure that the rights and needs of members and the organization are upheld during meetings.
