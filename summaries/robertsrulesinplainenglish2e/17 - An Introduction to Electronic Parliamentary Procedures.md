Electronic parliamentary procedures are becoming increasingly popular for organizations looking for cost-effective ways to share information and make decisions. These procedures involve holding electronic meetings, where participants communicate using electronic means. There are various types of teleconferencing, such as videoconferencing, computer conferencing, and audio conferencing, that can be used to facilitate these meetings.

There are several advantages to holding electronic meetings. They reduce the costs associated with large national and international meetings, making them a more affordable option. They are particularly useful for simple problem solving, information sharing, and procedural tasks. Additionally, electronic meetings increase attendance among members who may be unable to attend in person due to time constraints, climate, or transportation issues. It has also been observed that participants often engage more fully in well-moderated teleconferences compared to face-to-face meetings.

However, there are also disadvantages and challenges associated with electronic meetings. Technical and equipment failures may occur, affecting the smooth running of the meeting. The impersonal nature of electronic meetings can make it difficult to establish a rapport among participants. Furthermore, complex issues that require negotiation may be more difficult to decide on in an electronic meeting. It is also important to note that members may lack familiarity with the skills required to conduct electronic meetings and greater member preparation is necessary for a productive meeting. Assigning the floor, or determining the speaking order of members, can also be challenging in electronic meetings.

There are certain dangers that come with electronic meetings, particularly pertaining to the democratic principles that govern decision making in groups. While teleconferencing facilitates communication, it does not eliminate the challenges associated with group communication and decision making. In fact, it can even exacerbate these challenges. Therefore, it is important for organizations to carefully consider whether teleconferencing will hinder or help their decision-making processes. Face-to-face meetings still hold value and should not be underestimated.

Parliamentary law dictates that decisions be made by a majority of members present at a duly-called meeting with a quorum. For electronic meetings, specific requirements need to be met. The bylaws of the organization must state that electronic meetings are allowed. Proper notice of the meeting must be given, and a quorum must be present. Each member must have an opportunity to express their views and listen to others. A legal vote must be obtained through written ratification to verify the vote of an electronic meeting.

In order to preserve the democratic process in electronic meetings, special rules should be developed. These rules may include means of verifying members and a quorum, rules regarding debate (such as limiting the number of times a member can speak until everyone has had an opportunity to speak), procedures for obtaining the floor, and guidelines for taking and verifying votes. Criteria for when and how electronic meetings may be used should also be established.

Before transitioning to electronic meetings, organizations should consider if their members are comfortable with the idea and if they are computer literate with email addresses. It is also important to evaluate if an electronic meeting is the most appropriate format for the specific issue at hand. Some questions may require extensive discussion that may be better suited for a face-to-face meeting.

To begin incorporating electronic meetings, organizations can start by using them for information sharing and less important, routine matters that do not require much discussion. If this proves to be successful, more substantial issues can be addressed using electronic meetings.

Overall, electronic parliamentary procedures offer a cost-effective and accessible option for organizations to share information and make decisions. However, careful consideration must be given to the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges associated with these procedures to ensure the democratic process is maintained.
