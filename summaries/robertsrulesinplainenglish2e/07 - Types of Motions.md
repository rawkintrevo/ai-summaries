Types of Motions

Motions are categorized into two types: main motions and secondary motions. Main motions are proposals for certain action or the expression of an opinion by the group. These motions allow the group to carry out its work and make decisions. Main motions typically start with the phrase "I move." An example of a main motion could be, "I move that a playground be constructed in the community park with the surplus in the maintenance fund."

On the other hand, secondary motions can be made while a main motion is being discussed but before a decision has been made. They are divided into three classes: subsidiary motions, privileged motions, and incidental motions.

Subsidiary motions are motions that relate directly to the main motion on the floor. They are used to expedite business by dealing with the pending motion in various ways, such as changing the wording, sending it to a committee, or postponing it. Subsidiary motions have a rank or order of precedence among themselves. For example, a motion to postpone a decision until the next meeting has a higher rank than a motion to refer the decision to a special committee. The lower-ranking motion "yields" to the higher-ranking one.

Privileged motions, on the other hand, are motions of an emergency nature that are unrelated to the main motion on the floor. They are considered to be of high rank and must be addressed before any other business that may be pending. Examples of privileged motions include motions to recess or adjourn.

Incidental motions are procedural motions that deal with the process of the meeting, such as enforcing proper procedure, correcting errors, or verifying votes. They must be resolved before business can continue. An example of an incidental motion could be a motion to vote by secret ballot if the members feel that the issue is too divisive and a secret vote would be in the best interest of the group.

In Robert's Rules of Order, only the most commonly used subsidiary, privileged, and incidental motions are discussed in detail. The book also addresses the different characteristics of motions, such as whether they are debatable, amendable, or require a majority or two-thirds vote to pass.

The process of making and acting upon a motion involves several steps. Firstly, a member requests the floor by rising and addressing the chairperson. Once recognized by the chair, the member makes the motion by saying "I move." Another member may then second the motion, although motions from a committee do not require a second. If a motion fails to get a second, it is not considered. 

The chairperson restates the motion to clarify it for the members and to keep the discussion focused. The motion becomes pending and is open for debate. The chairperson opens the floor for discussion by saying, "Is there any discussion?" Members must wait to be recognized by the chairperson before speaking. The chairperson can also limit or close debate if necessary.

Once the debate is complete, the chairperson calls for a vote. The chairperson restates the motion again to remind members of what is being voted on. Members then say "aye" or "no" to indicate their vote. The chairperson interprets and announces the results of the vote.

Main motions have certain rules that govern them. They cannot interrupt a member who already has the floor, require a second (unless it is from a committee), can be debated, can be amended, and require a majority vote to pass. The chairperson can also require a long motion to be submitted in writing and can determine whether a motion is in order or should be ruled out.

Overall, understanding the different types of motions and how they are used in meetings is essential for conducting efficient and orderly business.
