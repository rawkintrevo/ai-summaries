The role of the secretary in an organization is crucial, especially when it comes to keeping accurate records of meetings through minutes. Minutes are written records that summarize the proceedings, decisions, proposals, and reports of a meeting. These minutes serve as the legal documentation of the organization's meetings and can be subpoenaed if needed. It is essential for minutes to be concise and accurate to ensure an accurate historical record of the organization's activities.

When writing minutes, there are certain guidelines that the secretary should follow. They should record all adopted motions, as well as motions that were lost or defeated. The name of the person who made the motion, as well as the names of all members reporting, should also be included. Additionally, the names of those elected or appointed, and the number of votes on each side in a ballot or counted vote, should be recorded.

On the other hand, there are certain things that the secretary should not include in the minutes. These include discussion or personal opinions, the name of the seconder of a motion, and motions that have been withdrawn. Entire reports should not be included in the minutes; instead, a brief summary should be provided, with the full report attached to the original minutes.

It is important to write the minutes as promptly as possible to ensure that the notes are clear and accurate. The secretary should also send a copy of the minutes to the president promptly and alert them to any unfinished business that needs attention. In addition, the secretary should be prepared to provide a summary of the executive board meetings and report motions to the membership.

Once the minutes have been written, the secretary should sign them and record the date of approval. If any corrections need to be made to the minutes, they should be noted specifically, including the date, page, and line in which the correction appears. It is common to make corrections in red ink, without obliterating the original text. Corrections can be made at the time of the reading or at any time, as long as they receive a two-thirds vote.

The contents of the minutes should include specific information about the meeting. The first paragraph should include the kind of meeting (regular or special), the name of the organization, the date and place of the meeting, and the presence of the president and secretary (or their substitutes). It should also mention whether a quorum was present and the time the meeting was called to order. It should conclude by stating whether the minutes of the previous meeting were approved or corrected.

The body of the minutes should include the reports given at the meeting, along with any related action taken. Main motions, points of order or appeal, and important announcements should also be recorded. The treasurer's report, for example, should include the balance on hand and whether it was filed for audit. Any resolutions or amendments to motions should be documented, along with the outcome of those votes. Additionally, any important information about the program or speaker should be mentioned.

The final paragraph of the minutes should include information about the adjournment of the meeting and the time of adjournment. The secretary can then sign the minutes and include the date of approval or any corrections made.

In addition to taking minutes, the secretary also has other duties in the organization. They are responsible for keeping official records, including the membership roll, a list of committees and their members, and a current copy of the bylaws with any amendments noted. The secretary may also assist in roll call votes by calling each member's name and recording their vote. They are typically responsible for sending out meeting notices and other correspondence, unless the organization has a corresponding secretary.

Overall, the role of the secretary in an organization is multifaceted, with a significant emphasis on accurate record-keeping through the minutes of meetings. By following the guidelines for writing minutes and fulfilling their other duties, the secretary plays a vital role in maintaining the organization's official records and ensuring transparency and accountability.
