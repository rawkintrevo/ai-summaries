Parliamentary procedure in America is based on the rules used in the English Parliament. However, early American parliamentary procedure was a simplified version of the complex system of English parliamentary law. Each colony in America had its own unique ideas of procedure, which led to a confusing state of affairs during the Continental Congress. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson compiled the Manual of Parliamentary Practice, which was adopted by both the House and the Senate to establish a uniform system of rules. However, the manual was too complex for the average citizen, who was increasingly forming different kinds of organizations.

In 1876, Henry Martyn Robert, an engineer, created the first edition of Robert's Rules of Order. This small book of rules was specifically designed for nonlegislative organizations and was based on the rules and practices of Congress. The first edition of Robert's Rules of Order became an instant success, as it provided groups with a clear and standardized set of rules for conducting their meetings.

Today, if Robert's Rules of Order is adopted as the parliamentary authority, the rules will be the same for any meeting in any state. Motions can be amended in the same way whether the meeting takes place in California or New York.

Robert's Rules of Order - The Basics

Robert's Rules of Order is a manual of parliamentary procedure that provides a set of rules and guidelines for running meetings effectively. It covers topics such as how to make motions, how to conduct debates, and how to facilitate decision-making within an organized group.

The basic principle of parliamentary procedure is to have a system in place that allows for the democratic transaction of decision-making. It ensures that all members have a chance to voice their opinions, that decisions are made in a fair and orderly manner, and that the majority rule is respected.

One of the key features of Robert's Rules of Order is its emphasis on the importance of following a specific order of business. The order of business typically includes the following steps: calling the meeting to order, reading the minutes of the previous meeting, presenting reports and special orders, conducting general business, and adjourning the meeting.

Another important aspect of Robert's Rules of Order is the process of making motions. A motion is a proposal made by a member to take a specific action or make a decision. There are different types of motions, such as main motions, subsidiary motions, privileged motions, and incidental motions. Each type of motion serves a different purpose and has its own rules for debate and voting.

Once a motion is made, it must be seconded by another member before it can be considered. The chairperson then opens the floor for debate, allowing members to express their opinions and ask questions about the motion. After a reasonable amount of debate, the chairperson calls for a vote on the motion. A motion is typically adopted if it receives a majority vote, although in some cases a two-thirds majority may be required.

Robert's Rules of Order also provides guidelines for conducting meetings in an orderly manner. It encourages members to be respectful and courteous to one another, to avoid personal attacks or insults, and to focus on the issues at hand. It also emphasizes the importance of following the agenda and keeping the discussions relevant to the topic at hand.

In addition to these basic rules, Robert's Rules of Order also covers topics such as elections, committees, and the rights and responsibilities of members. It provides guidance on how to handle common issues that may arise in a meeting, such as points of order, appeals, and the use of proxies.

Overall, Robert's Rules of Order is a valuable tool for ensuring that meetings are conducted in a fair and efficient manner. It provides a systematic framework for making decisions, resolving conflicts, and maintaining order within an organized group. By following the rules and guidelines outlined in Robert's Rules of Order, groups can ensure that their meetings are productive and democratic.
