Incidental motions are a type of motion that relate to procedure and do not directly pertain to the main question being discussed. They are called "incidental" because they arise by chance during the course of a meeting. These motions must be addressed before business can continue. Incidental motions do not have a ranking system among themselves and can be applied to any main motion. They are decided upon as they arise and are usually not debatable. Amendments to incidental motions are also rare.

One example of an incidental motion is the "point of order." This motion is used when a member feels that the Chair is not operating within the rules. By raising a point of order, the member alerts the rest of the group to a breach of procedure and requires the Chair to defend their ruling. For example, a member may raise a point of order if they believe an amendment made during the meeting is out of order because there is already an amendment and an amendment to the amendment pending. The Chair would then rule on the point of order, and if it is deemed valid, the amendment would be ruled out of order.

Another incidental motion is the "appeal." This motion allows any two members to counter what they believe is an incorrect or unfair ruling by the Chair. If the appeal is seconded, the Chair must then submit the ruling to a vote of the group. The group can then vote in favor of the ruling of the Chair or against it, thereby reversing it. For example, a member may appeal the decision of the Chair if they believe that an amendment offered is germane. The Chair would then put the appeal to a vote, with a majority in favor of the Chair's ruling sustaining it.

There are also two motions that are useful for obtaining additional information or parliamentary help. The "point of information" motion is used to ask for additional information on the subject being discussed. For example, a member may rise to a point of information to ask about the amount of surplus in the maintenance fund and the financial impact of constructing a playground. The "parliamentary inquiry" motion is used to obtain parliamentary assistance. For example, a member may rise to a parliamentary question to ask if it is in order to move that the question of constructing a playground be postponed to the next meeting.

There are a couple of motions that deal with verifying or dividing a vote. The "division" motion allows any one member to demand that the Chair verify a vote. The Chair must then retake the vote in a manner that allows the group to see and be assured of the correctness of the call. The "division of a question" motion is used when a motion or resolution contains several parts, and the group wishes to vote on each part separately.

Another incidental motion is the "objection to the consideration of a question." This motion is used when a member believes that it would be harmful for a particular motion to come before the group for discussion and vote. It requires a two-thirds vote to suppress the motion.

Lastly, there is the "permission to withdraw a motion" motion. This allows a member who realizes they have made a hasty or ill-advised motion to withdraw it with the consent of the group. It saves time in disposing of the motion. The presiding officer usually handles this request by seeking general consent from the group.

Overall, incidental motions are used to address procedural issues that arise during a meeting. They ensure that the rules are followed and allow for clarification or additional information to be obtained. By understanding and using these motions effectively, meetings can run more smoothly and efficiently.
