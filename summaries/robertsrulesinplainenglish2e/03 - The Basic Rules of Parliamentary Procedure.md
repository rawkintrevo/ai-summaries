Parliamentary procedure is a set of rules and guidelines that are used to conduct business and make decisions in a group setting. These rules help to ensure that meetings are orderly, fair, and efficient. There are ten basic rules of parliamentary procedure that all members must follow.

The first rule states that the rights of the organization supersede the rights of individual members. This means that the organization has the right to make its own rules and conduct its business in an orderly manner. If there is a conflict between the rights of a member and the organization, the rights of the organization prevail. For example, if a member is disrupting a meeting by arguing and calling out objections, the organization has the right to eject that member.

The second rule states that all members are equal and have the same rights. These rights include attending meetings, making motions, speaking in debate, nominating, voting, and holding office. Each member has the right to voice their opinions and participate in the decision-making process. However, in order to speak in a debate, a member must seek recognition from the chair and be assigned the floor.

The third rule states that a quorum must be present to do business. A quorum is the minimum number of members that must be present in order for the organization to legally transact business. The number of members required for a quorum is usually stated in the organization's bylaws. The purpose of a quorum is to ensure that decisions are made by a representative group of members. If a quorum is not present at a meeting, no action can be taken by the organization.

The fourth rule states that the majority rules. This means that decisions are made by a majority vote of the members present and voting. The minority has the right to be heard, but once a decision has been reached by a majority vote, the minority must respect and abide by that decision.

The fifth rule states that silence is consent. If a member does not vote, they are implicitly agreeing to go along with the decision of the majority. This rule helps to expedite the decision-making process and ensures that all members have an opportunity to express their opinions.

The sixth rule states that a two-thirds vote is required to limit or take away the rights of members, or to change a decision that has already been made. This rule helps to protect the rights of individual members and ensures that major decisions are not made without careful consideration.

The seventh rule states that only one question can be considered at a time, and only one speaker can have the floor at a time. This helps to focus the discussion and prevent confusion. If a member wants to introduce a new motion or speak on a different topic, they must wait until the current question has been resolved and they have been recognized by the chair.

The eighth rule states that debatable motions must receive full debate. The presiding officer cannot put a debatable motion to a vote as long as there are members who wish to debate it. Debate can only be suspended by a two-thirds vote of the members present. This rule ensures that all members have an opportunity to express their opinions and fully discuss the motion before a decision is made.

The ninth rule states that once a question is decided, it is not in order to bring up the same motion or a similar one at the same meeting. This rule helps to prevent repetitive discussions and ensures that decisions are made in a timely manner. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as restorative motions which allow a motion to be brought back to the group for further consideration.

The tenth rule states that personal remarks in debate are always out of order. Members must focus on the motions and not make personal attacks or comments about other members. This rule helps to maintain civility and respect within the organization.

These ten rules form the basis of parliamentary procedure and provide a framework for conducting business and making decisions in an organized and fair manner. By following these rules, organizations can ensure that all members have a voice and that decisions are made in the best interest of the group as a whole.
