Federal government contracting is a process that the government uses to acquire the supplies and services it needs to run its operations or fulfill its mission requirements. The government spends billions of dollars each year buying goods and services from nonfederal sources. In order to participate in federal contracting, a business must understand how the government does business and position itself accordingly. There are over 350,000 government contractors receiving more than $500 billion worth of contracts each year, with $100 billion going to small businesses.

The federal government is the largest consumer in the world, with no other nation or corporation being able to match its purchasing power. The government purchases a wide range of products and services, from high-technology items like homeland security programs and telecommunication systems to more mundane items like office furniture and food. The government's needs vary and can be met by individuals, small businesses, and large corporations.

Selling to the federal government offers many advantages, including a vast customer base, the availability of government programs and services to help small businesses participate in federal contracting, and the potential for large profits and growth. However, there are also disadvantages, including government red tape, the need to learn how the government operates, and the strict regulations and requirements associated with government contracts.

The government operates in a monopsonistic market, with only one buyer (the government) and many sellers (contractors). This gives the government certain powers and immunities that differ from more typical buyers. The government determines its own procurement actions and profit margins, and federal contracts contain extensive clauses that contractors must adhere to.

The future of federal contracting is uncertain, with the Obama administration expressing concerns about the cost effectiveness of contracting out government services and the performance of contractors. However, the government still relies heavily on private industry contractors for the performance of many services, and the flexible nature of contractors makes them a favorable choice for government contracts.

Overall, federal contracting provides businesses with a unique opportunity to work with the largest consumer in the world and can be a valuable source of revenue. However, it requires a deep understanding of the government procurement process and the ability to navigate through government regulations and red tape.
