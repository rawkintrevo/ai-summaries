In this chapter, the author discusses the process of marketing to the federal government. They begin by noting that marketing to the government is different from marketing to other industries because the government’s purchases are funded by tax dollars, meaning that they have a higher degree of accountability for how those funds are spent. The government requires full and open competition for purchases, and this ensures that contractors can compete for contracts without having to belong to an exclusive country club.

The author suggests that there is no one way to market to the government because each federal agency acquires goods and services differently. However, understanding the government’s procurement methods and support services can be helpful. The chapter explores various methods of marketing to the government and provides tips on how to incorporate them into business marketing plans.

The first method discussed is finding markets for a company’s supplies and services. The author notes that federal contracting can be done from anywhere in the country, as the government has buying offices and facilities located throughout the country. The author suggests that researching and finding government contracting opportunities in a company’s local area can be beneficial, as local facilities may prefer to buy from hometown businesses.

The author also suggests that businesses should consider their location, business type, and experience when deciding which markets to concentrate on. They note that densely populated areas tend to have larger government markets, so businesses located in these areas can focus on using a business center close to their location. On the other hand, businesses in rural areas may need to use a business center farther away, as these areas have fewer buying offices. The author suggests that new businesses should start by targeting opportunities near home, while businesses with more experience and a share of the local market can consider expanding their market base.

The chapter then discusses finding agencies online. Each federal agency has its own website, and businesses can browse these websites to familiarize themselves with the agency and its procurement processes. The author provides examples of how to find agency websites based on their acronym and notes that most federal government websites have a “.gov” domain.

The next section discusses FedBizOpps, which is the single government point of entry on the web for federal procurements over $25,000. FedBizOpps allows contractors to search, monitor, and retrieve opportunities solicited by the entire federal contracting community. To illustrate how to use FedBizOpps, the author provides a step-by-step guide on how to search for opportunities in a specific state and industry.

The chapter then discusses the importance of being on a Federal Supply Schedule (GSA Schedule). GSA schedules allow businesses to establish long-term contracts with federal agencies for their products and services. Businesses on a GSA schedule join a list of preferred vendors and gain access to government buying offices. The author notes that government business tends to complement commercial business, as schedule orders tend to be larger and government buyers place orders at different times of the year.

The author also mentions the Federal Register, which is the daily newspaper that informs the public of congressional and federal enactments and regulatory activities. Paying attention to the Federal Register can help businesses anticipate the government’s priorities and program changes. The Federal Register can be accessed online.

The chapter then discusses federal agency acquisition forecasts, which are one-year projections of contracting opportunities that small businesses can perform. Most federal agencies announce their acquisition forecasts online, and businesses can use these forecasts to anticipate future contract actions or awards. The chapter provides links to websites where these forecasts can be found.

The author also introduces TECH-Net, which is a search engine that features a database of high-tech small businesses. Businesses can use their profiles on TECH-Net to market their capabilities and accomplishments and gain access to technology procurement opportunities. The author provides a link to the TECH-Net website.

The chapter then discusses the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), which collects, develops, and disseminates data on the government’s spending on supplies and services. FPDS provides visibility into procurement and acquisition activities within federal agencies and allows users to search and analyze procurement history and spending trends. The author notes that many of the dollar figures used in the book came directly from FPDS.

Finally, the chapter discusses year-end procurements, which tend to be especially busy for federal agencies. Funding for federal agencies typically expires at the end of the government’s fiscal year on September 30, so agencies are often in a rush to spend their remaining funds. The author suggests that businesses can take advantage of this by being aware of the government’s situation and offering their products and services during this time.

Overall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the methods and strategies involved in marketing to the federal government. The author acknowledges that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and emphasizes the importance of being persistent and understanding the specific needs and processes of each federal agency.
