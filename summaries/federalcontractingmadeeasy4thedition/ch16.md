Contracts come in many different types that provide the government with flexibility in different contracting situations. Some of these other contract types include indefinite-delivery contracts, time-and-materials contracts, labor-hour contracts, letter contracts, basic ordering agreements, performance-based contracting, multiyear contracts, options, and life-cycle costing.

Indefinite-delivery contracts are used when the government cannot specify the exact delivery dates and quantities that will be required. These contracts allow the contractors to maintain a limited stock of supplies and permit direct shipment to federal agencies. Requirements contracts are a type of indefinite-delivery contract used when the government has recurring needs but cannot specify the exact quantities required. These contracts do not guarantee that a contractor will receive any orders, but the government promises to buy all of its requirements from one vendor. Indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contracts are also used when there is a recurring need for similar supplies or services. These contracts provide for an indefinite quantity of supplies or services to be furnished during a fixed period.

Time-and-materials contracts are used when it is difficult to estimate the costs or extent of the work at the time of contract award. These contracts combine the features of cost-reimbursement contracts and fixed-price contracts. Direct labor is provided at fixed hourly rates, and the contractor provides materials at cost.

Labor-hour contracts are a variation of time-and-materials contracts where the contractor does not supply materials. The government issues letter contracts in cases of national emergencies to provide immediate relief. A letter contract is a written preliminary contractual instrument that authorizes a contractor to begin manufacturing products or performing services immediately.

Basic ordering agreements are written instruments of understanding negotiated between the government and a contractor. These agreements allow the government to expedite the procurement of products or services when specific items, quantities, and prices are unknown at the time of the agreement.

Performance-based contracting aims to base the total amount paid to a contractor on the level of performance quality achieved and contract standards met. This motivates the contractor to perform at its best and includes measurable performance standards and procedures for reductions in fee or price for non-performance.

Multiyear contracts are for the purchase of products and services for more than one year, but not more than five years. These contracts allow contractors to offer better overall prices while maintaining a steady workload.

Options give the government the right to purchase additional products or services under a contract. The government considers price and other factors before exercising an option.

Life-cycle costing is a method used in source selection and cost analysis. It estimates the total cost of acquiring, developing, operating, supporting, and disposing of an item or system. This helps in making decisions and reducing operating and support costs.

The selection of a contract type should be based on an objective analysis of all factors involved and the contract type that fits the particular procurement.
