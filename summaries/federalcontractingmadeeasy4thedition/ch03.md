In this chapter, the key players in federal acquisition personnel are highlighted. The chapter starts by emphasizing the importance of understanding the key players as the federal government is a large bureaucracy with over two million employees and over 2,500 contracting activities.

The head of the contracting activity (HCA) is responsible for managing the contracting activity of a federal agency. The HCA or their designee appoints individuals as contracting officers. The head of agency has the responsibility and authority to contract for supplies and services needed for agency missions. The agency head must establish a system for selecting and appointing contracting officers and must maintain a procurement career-management program.

A contracting officer (CO) is the official buyer for the federal government. They enter into, administer, or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings. They are the only person who can bind the government to a contract over the micropurchase threshold of $3,000. A contracting officer is issued a Certificate of Appointment, also known as a warrant, which identifies their authority and limitations. They ensure compliance with contract terms, safeguard the government's interests, and ensure sufficient funds are available. Contracting officers often request the help of specialists in auditing, law, engineering, and other fields when making determinations.

The principal or procuring contracting officer (PCO) is responsible for issuing solicitations, accepting bids and proposals, and making the original award of the contract. They are the person to contact if there are problems with a solicitation before award.

The administrative contracting officer (ACO) is responsible for the administrative aspects of a contract, such as monitoring the contractor's performance, inspecting and accepting their supplies and services, and ensuring they are properly paid. They work closely with the contracting officer but have the authority to make decisions that affect the contract. The contracting officer still has the final authority on significant contract issues.

The contracting officer's representative (COR) or contracting officer's technical representative (COTR) assist the contracting officer in ensuring the contractor's performance is in accordance with the contract's terms and conditions. They provide technical advice, update the contracting officer on the contract's status, perform inspections and quality assurance functions, and report any unusual circumstances or issues.

In cases where a contract may be terminated, a termination contracting officer (TCO) is typically used. The TCO is responsible for the settlement process, reviewing settlement proposals submitted by the contractor, and approving them on behalf of the government.

Competition advocates are responsible for promoting full and open competition within federal agencies. They challenge barriers to competition and review the agency's contracting operations to ensure appropriate actions are being taken to encourage competition. Small business specialists assist and counsel businesses on acquisition regulations and practices, help businesses find buying offices and data on procurements, and ensure a fair portion of contracts are awarded to small businesses.

Requirements personnel, also known as end users, are government employees responsible for determining the supplies and services needed by federal agencies. They prepare budgets and make purchases based on agency needs. Contractors can reach out to requirements personnel to learn about the agency's current and future needs and to establish relationships.

Understanding these key players and focusing efforts on them is crucial for successful contracting with the federal government. Pre-selling before a public solicitation is encouraged and can give contractors an insider edge.
