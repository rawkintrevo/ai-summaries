Negotiated procurement procedures are used by the federal government when they want to consider the technical superiority of a contractor's products or services. This allows for bargaining and discussions with potential contractors before making a final source selection. Negotiated procurements are the most flexible acquisition method, but also the most complicated.

Negotiated procurements can take various forms, including competitive proposals, restricted competition, or even sole source. These procedures are often used for R&D projects where each contractor may have a different approach to meeting the government's needs.

The most common solicitation document used in negotiated procurement procedures is a Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFP contains all the necessary information for potential contractors to prepare their proposals. It is important to note that the RFP is not referred to as the "bid set" because the word "bid" is associated with sealed bidding and not negotiated procurements.

The RFP is essentially a request for an offer, and the contractor's response to the RFP represents an offer that the government can accept without change or negotiation, resulting in a binding contract. However, the solicitation must state whether the intent is to evaluate and award proposals after discussions with offerors or without discussions. Even if discussions are not indicated, the agency still reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary.

If discussions are to be held, the contracting officer must conduct written or oral discussions with all responsible offerors that submit proposals within the competitive range. During these discussions, price, technical requirements, performance, terms and conditions, and delivery schedules are all open to negotiation. The contracting officer may also determine that a contract significantly different from the original solicitation would better serve the government's interests.

When using negotiated procedures, it is important for the contracting officer to ensure that all contractors are treated fairly and impartially, but they do not have to be treated the same. The contract must provide the winning contractor with incentive to perform the contract on time and at the lowest possible cost to the government. Additionally, the contract price must be fair and reasonable.

Before receiving proposals, the government encourages exchanges with industry to improve the understanding of government requirements and industry capabilities. Techniques that the government may use to promote these exchanges include industry conferences, public hearings, market research, one-on-one meetings with potential offerors, presolicitation notices, draft RFPs, requests for information (RFI), presolicitation conferences, and site visits.

The solicitation process starts with the publication of a synopsis of the RFP in FedBizOpps, followed by the actual publication of the RFP. If necessary, a pre-proposal conference may be held to explain complicated specifications and requirements to prospective offerors. The contracting officer uses various formats to prepare RFPs, such as the Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items (SF 1449), Uniform Contract Format (SF 33), or Simplified Contract Format (SF 1447).

RFPs for competitive acquisitions must provide the government's requirements, the anticipated terms and conditions of the contract, information required for the offeror's proposal, and the evaluation factors and their relative importance.

Preparing a proposal in response to an RFP requires considerable time and effort, usually costing 3-5% of the contract's total dollar value. Evaluation factors include technical requirements, management capabilities, and relevant experience and past performance. The contracting officer tailors these factors to each acquisition's characteristics and requirements.

Cost and pricing data are also important in a proposal. Offerors must provide estimates of expected costs of performance and their expected profit or fee. The cost/price evaluation factors differ for different contract types, such as fixed-price, incentive, and cost-reimbursement contracts.

The technical proposal is meant to assure the government that the contractor has the necessary know-how and resources to perform the contract requirements. The management proposal details how the contractor intends to manage the proposed program if awarded the contract.

Oral presentations may be requested by the government to enhance or substitute written portions of the proposal. These presentations may cover an offeror's capabilities, past performance, work plans or approaches, staffing resources, and transition plans.

Late proposals are generally not considered unless there was a mishandling of the proposal by the government, or the proposal was sent through specific mail services or electronically by a certain deadline. The government may consider late modifications to a proposal if it makes the terms more favorable.

The proposal evaluation process involves the contracting officer evaluating technical and cost/price proposals, negotiating, and then requesting final proposal revisions. The source selection decision is based on the content of the final proposal revisions and the contracting officer's evaluation.

There are different source selection processes and techniques that can be used, such as the best value continuum, trade-off process, and lowest price, technically acceptable process.

Debriefings are offered to both successful and unsuccessful offerors. During a debriefing, the contracting officer discusses with the offeror why their proposal was or was not chosen for award.

Protests can be filed by contractors who disagree with the government's decision. Protests must be filed within ten days of the basis for the protest being known or should have been known. Protests are written objections to a solicitation, proposed award, or award of a contract. They can be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or directly with the contracting officer or buying agency. Protests are typically considered by the GAO, who then requests a report from the contracting officer. Decisions are usually made within 100 days of the initial receipt of the protest.
