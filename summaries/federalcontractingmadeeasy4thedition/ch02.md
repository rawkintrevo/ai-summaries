The chapter titled "The Rules of the Game" provides an overview of the various rules and regulations that govern federal contracting. The chapter begins by emphasizing the importance of understanding these rules and regulations in order to navigate the government marketplace successfully.

The chapter covers a wide range of topics, including constitutional authority, congressional responsibilities, central contractor registration, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, cost accounting standards, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1996, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, the Buy American Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Service Contract Act of 1965, and the Freedom of Information Act.

The chapter explains that the U.S. Constitution gives the federal government the legal authority to enter into contracts with private citizens and commercial organizations, even though the constitution does not explicitly authorize such actions. The chapter also highlights the role of Congress in passing laws and statutes that establish federal agencies and regulate federal contracting.

The chapter goes on to discuss the importance of contractor registration, particularly with the System for Award Management (SAM), which is a one-stop repository and application service for government buyers to locate contractors. The chapter explains the registration process for SAM, which includes obtaining a DUNS number from Dun & Bradstreet and providing various information about the business.

The chapter then delves into the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which is considered the "bible" for federal contractors. The FAR contains uniform policies and procedures for federal acquisitions, and each executive branch agency is required to adhere to the FAR when making purchases with congressionally appropriated funds. The chapter explains the FAR numbering system, which covers different aspects of federal procurement and contracting, and discusses Federal Acquisition Circulars (FACs), which are updates to the FAR.

The chapter also provides information on the various agency supplements to the FAR, which contain policies and procedures specific to each federal agency. These supplements should not contradict the FAR but provide additional guidance for dealing with specific agencies.

Other topics covered in the chapter include the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1996, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, the Buy American Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Service Contract Act of 1965, and the Freedom of Information Act.

Overall, the chapter serves as a comprehensive overview of the rules and regulations that contractors must navigate in the federal contracting process. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and complying with these rules in order to succeed in the government marketplace.
