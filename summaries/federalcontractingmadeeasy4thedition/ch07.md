Federal supply schedules, also known as GSA schedules, are a procurement method used by the US government to quickly acquire commercial products and services. These schedules are managed by the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), a division of the General Services Administration (GSA). The schedules offer over 30 million commercial products and services from over 21,000 suppliers, and account for close to $40 billion in federal purchases each year.

To be eligible for the Federal Supply Schedule program, a contractor must have its schedule contract approved by FAS. The schedule contract is a stamp of approval for the company's listed products and services and allows them to close federal sales. The advantages of having a GSA schedule include being preapproved to contract with federal agencies, exposure to a large number of contracting activities, and the ability to offer volume discounts on purchases. Additionally, state and local governments and certain prime contractors are also able to purchase from GSA schedules.

Getting on a GSA schedule involves going through an application process that can take months to complete. The contractor needs to identify the federal supply schedule that covers their products or services, review the solicitation for that schedule, and complete all the necessary information. Once the contract is successfully negotiated, the business is assigned a GSA contract number and placed on a list of approved suppliers for that particular schedule.

Marketing plays a crucial role in generating sales through a GSA schedule. Contractors need to develop a contract price list and distribute it to potential customers, including mailing a hard copy of the price list and company brochure to prospective customers. They can also utilize the GSA e-Library, GSA Advantage, and MarkeTips magazine to market their products and services to government buyers.

In addition to GSA schedules, there are also government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs) that focus solely on information technology products and services. These contracts are more limited in terms of the number of vendors awarded and the types of products and services covered.

While having a GSA schedule can provide opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses to access government contracts, there are challenges as well. The competition in selling commercial products and services to the government is fierce, and small businesses often struggle to maintain profitability due to low markups on their sales. Large businesses have an advantage due to their ability to maintain larger sales volumes and cover more indirect expenses. Additionally, manufacturers may prefer to sell their products directly to the government rather than using a regular dealer, further limiting opportunities for small businesses.

Overall, obtaining a GSA schedule and effectively marketing products and services to government buyers can be a valuable strategy for businesses looking to access the government marketplace. However, careful planning, cost management, and aggressive marketing are essential for success.
