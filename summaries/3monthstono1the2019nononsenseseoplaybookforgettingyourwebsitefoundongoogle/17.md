In Week 5, the goal is to establish your business entity and online brand through various social media profiles. You will set up profiles on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google My Business, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr, Blogger, and About.me. It is important to interlink all of these accounts and add social media schema markup for SEO purposes. Additionally, you can use a tool like Hootsuite to schedule and automate your social media posts.

Week 6 is focused on submitting your brand's website to directories. You should set a schedule over the next three weeks to submit your website to 10 national, 10 local, and 10 niche directories. In the first week, you will submit your URL to 10 national directories. You can use the resources provided to find a list of suggested national directories. It is recommended to continue building directory links beyond week 11 only if you are trying to compete for the top position on Google Map Listings.

In Week 7, you will set up an account with Help a Reporter Out (HARO) and systemize its email delivery. HARO is a free tool that helps generate links for your website. By setting up HARO, you can receive queries from journalists and bloggers who are looking for expert sources. It is important to filter the HARO emails to minimize the amount of work required. You will also write an email template for responding to HARO queries.

Week 8 focuses on review accumulation. You should solicit reviews from friends and family on Google. It is recommended to stagger asking for reviews to avoid an influx of reviews that can appear suspicious to Google. You should also sign up for online review portals such as Yell.com, Trustpilot.com, and an industry-specific reviews website. Implementing schema markup for existing reviews can help increase their visibility in search engine results. Finally, you should systemize the accumulation of online reviews by creating business cards that ask for Google reviews and handing them out to customers and acquaintances.

In Week 9, you will perform content research and create an editorial calendar. Using Buzzsumo, you should come up with at least 15 content ideas such as articles, videos, audio, and imagery. Perform keyword research for every piece of textual content and attribute publishing dates to each content idea. It is recommended to produce a high-quality piece of content every two weeks. Create a spreadsheet that details each piece of content's title, primary keyword, ancillary keywords, completion and publishing dates, and any further notes on the piece's angle.

Weeks 10, 11, and 12 onwards focus on content promotion and outreach. You will release content according to your editorial calendar and coincide social media posts with each content release. Perform manual outreach and automated outreach using tools like Pitchbox.com. You should also solicit bloggers in your industry to allow you to guest post on their sites. Additionally, perform a press release with every content piece being published if budget permits.

The author also mentions that it is important to have faith in the SEO process and the value of creating good-quality content. Results may not come immediately, but if you continue to create valuable content and promote it online, links and rankings will follow, leading to success.
