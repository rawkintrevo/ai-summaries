In this chapter, the author discusses the importance of on-page optimization and page relevance in SEO. The chapter begins with an analogy, comparing Google's algorithm to a visually impaired child. The author explains that Google's algorithm has evolved over the years and has become more sophisticated in understanding the context and intent behind user queries.

The author emphasizes the need to focus on topics rather than individual keywords when optimizing web pages. They provide an example of a plumber trying to optimize their website for various keywords related to plumbing services. Instead of creating separate pages for each keyword, the author suggests creating topic pages that target multiple keywords within the same overall subject. They explain that it is important to identify a primary keyword within each topic and focus on that, as Google will likely consider the page relevant to other related keywords too.

The chapter then delves into the factors that impact on-page optimization, focusing specifically on page relevance. The author explains that the content on a website is one of the few things that a website owner has control over and it should be made as relevant as possible to the target keywords. They discuss the eight tablets of on-page SEO, which include URLs, title tags, header tags, keyword use and density, latent semantic indexing (LSI), image filenames and alt tags, outbound links, and topic relevance.

For each factor, the author provides an explanation and tips on how to optimize it. They stress the importance of including the primary keyword in the URL and keeping it short. They also explain the significance of title tags and how they should include the primary keyword near the beginning of the tag. Header tags are discussed as a way to indicate the structure and content of the page to Google. The author suggests using logical header tags and including synonyms to emphasize relevance to the primary keyword.

Keyword use and density are explained as important factors in communicating relevance to Google. The author advises finding the keyword densities of top-ranking competitors and using them as a benchmark. Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is introduced as a technique to include related phrases and synonyms for the primary keyword to further emphasize relevance. The author suggests using tools like Google, online tools, and competitor analysis to find LSI keywords.

The next factor discussed is image filenames and alt tags. The author explains that these should be optimized with the primary keyword and relevant descriptions for the alt tags. Outbound links are presented as a way to reference external resources and Google considers them as a factor in determining page relevance. The author recommends including 1 or 2 outbound links to highly authoritative websites related to the content.

Lastly, the author emphasizes the importance of topic relevance in SEO. They explain that creating supporting pages on related topics and linking them back to the primary page can help establish authority and relevance in Google's eyes. The author suggests creating high-quality articles on related topics and linking them internally to the primary page.

Overall, the chapter provides insights and tips on optimizing web pages for relevance and improving on-page SEO. The author stresses the need to focus on topics, include relevant keywords and related phrases, and optimize various elements like URLs, title tags, header tags, and image filenames and alt tags.
