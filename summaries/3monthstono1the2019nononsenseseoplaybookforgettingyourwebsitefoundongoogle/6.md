Chapter 12 focuses on the importance of keywords in SEO. The chapter begins by defining keywords as any word or multi-word phrase that a user types into a search bar. The author emphasizes that keywords are crucial in SEO because they determine a website's rankings and success. The chapter categorizes keywords into three groups based on the intent of the user: informational/entertainment keywords, commercial keywords, and branded keywords. 

The chapter then delves into the process of keyword hunting, which is also known as keyword research. The author stresses the importance of thorough planning and research in order to choose the right keywords. The process begins with brainstorming common sense keywords that are relevant to the website's industry or niche. The author provides an example of a plumbing business in Putney, West London, and suggests keywords such as "plumber West London" and "emergency plumber Putney." 

The next phase of keyword hunting involves gathering keywords from Google using tools such as UberSuggest and Google's Keyword Planner Tool. The author provides step-by-step instructions on how to use these tools to generate keyword ideas and determine their potential value. The chapter emphasizes the need to choose keywords with enough search volume, commercial intent, and realistic competition levels.

Chapter 12 concludes with a discussion on the importance of focusing on a few keywords rather than trying to target too many. The author advises choosing a maximum of 10 keywords to concentrate on for better manageability and effectiveness.

Chapter 13 discusses the influence of domain names on SEO. The chapter begins by explaining that a domain's SEO strength lies in its history and age rather than its actual content. The author gives an example of transferring all the files of the BBC's website to a new domain and explains that the new domain would have no online visibility due to its lack of history and standing in Google. 

The chapter then explains the three types of domain names: exact match domains (EMD), partial match domains (PMD), and branded domains. An EMD contains only the targeted keyword or phrase, while a PMD includes the keyword along with other words. A branded domain does not contain the targeted keyword or phrase. 

The author advises choosing a branded domain for SEO purposes, as Google places less emphasis on domain names compared to the past. The author cautions against over-optimization and the risk of penalties from Google. The chapter emphasizes the importance of a long-term SEO strategy and the potential rewards of focusing on a branded domain. 

The chapter concludes with a discussion on registering domains and the importance of consistency in contact information for SEO purposes. The author also briefly mentions the option of adding WHOIS privacy to a domain and its impact on SEO. 

Overall, these chapters provide valuable insights into the importance of keywords and domain names in SEO. They emphasize the need for thorough research and planning to choose the right keywords and domains for a successful SEO campaign.
