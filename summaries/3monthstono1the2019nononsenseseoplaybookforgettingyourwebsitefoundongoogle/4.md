The chapter discusses the three main types of SEO business models: affiliate SEO, business SEO, and client SEO. The author explains each model in detail and discusses the pros and cons of each.

Affiliate SEO involves recommending or referencing someone else's product or service on your website in exchange for a commission. This model allows you to earn passive income by ranking your website high on search engines and attracting customers to click on your affiliate links. It is a scalable and potentially lucrative model, but it lacks control over Google's ranking algorithm and the terms of the affiliate commissions. It also has high levels of competition.

Business SEO, on the other hand, is using SEO as a marketing tool for your own product or service. The author emphasizes the importance of good marketing for business success and explains how SEO can be a powerful tool to increase visibility and attract customers. He discusses opportunities for local businesses and the advantages of national or global targeting. The author also introduces a cash formula to demonstrate the value of SEO for a business. The formula involves choosing keywords, analyzing competitors, estimating traffic volume, calculating additional customers, and determining extra revenue.

Client SEO is when SEO practitioners are paid to conduct SEO campaigns for businesses and help them make more money. The author emphasizes the importance of delivering value to clients and explains that the extent to which you get paid depends on how much value you deliver. He also discusses the growth of the SEO industry and the high demand for skilled SEO practitioners. He mentions the lack of regulation in the industry and advises readers to gain knowledge and experience in SEO to become valuable to businesses.

Overall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the three types of SEO business models and highlights the potential for profit and success in the field of SEO. The author encourages readers to choose a model that aligns with their personality and interests and emphasizes the importance of delivering value to clients.
