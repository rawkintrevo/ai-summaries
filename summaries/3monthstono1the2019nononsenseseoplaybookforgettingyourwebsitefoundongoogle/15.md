Chapter 22 of an undisclosed work discusses eCommerce SEO and the challenges and strategies involved in optimizing an eCommerce website for search engines. The chapter begins by addressing the competitive nature of selling multiple products online, with prominent eCommerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart dominating the market. However, the chapter argues that it is still possible for newcomers to succeed in eCommerce with a niche-focused approach.

The chapter emphasizes the importance of website structure in eCommerce SEO. Maintaining a logical site architecture is crucial for conveying the relevance and importance of pages to search engines. It is recommended to limit the number of subdirectories and keep product pages within two subdirectories from the root directory to strike a balance between deep and wide URL structures.

Keyword research is discussed as an essential component of eCommerce SEO. The chapter highlights the difference between keyword research for category pages and product pages. Category pages generally target broader, shorter keywords with higher search volume, while product pages focus on longer, more specific keywords, including long-tail variations. Long-tail keywords are longer and more specific phrases that target a more specific audience.

On-page optimization is another critical aspect of eCommerce SEO. The chapter states that all the principles of on-page SEO discussed earlier apply to eCommerce sites, but there are some differences for eCommerce stores. Specifically, page titles and meta descriptions should consider the user's attitude towards purchasing products online. Consumers searching for commoditized products have less patience and are primarily looking for websites that offer the desired product at a competitive price. Therefore, page titles and meta descriptions should include keywords with sales-oriented modifiers that appeal to bargain hunters.

Schema markup is discussed as a technical aspect of eCommerce SEO that can enhance search results. By implementing schema markup on eCommerce web pages, website owners can provide more context to search engines, resulting in rich snippets displayed in search results. Rich snippets include additional information such as ratings, reviews, product photos, and prices, which can attract more clicks and improve the quality of the traffic.

The chapter highlights several types of rich snippets that are particularly relevant for eCommerce websites. These include reviews and ratings, product name and pricing, limited-time offers, and product availability. By using schema code to display these rich snippets, eCommerce websites can increase click-through rates, create a sense of urgency, and highlight competitive pricing or product availability.

Overall, the chapter provides insights into the unique challenges of eCommerce SEO and offers practical strategies for optimizing an eCommerce website to stand out in a competitive market. It emphasizes the importance of website structure, keyword research, on-page optimization, and schema markup for achieving success in eCommerce SEO.
