In Chapter 14 of the book, the author introduces the concept of the Four Pillars of SEO. They emphasize that SEO is easy and can be achieved by focusing on these four key aspects. The first pillar is relevance, which means ensuring that every page on a website has a specific target topic and is rich in associated target keywords. It is important to create content that is useful to the end user. The second pillar is crawlability, which refers to making it easy for Google to scan and inspect web pages. This can be done by optimizing the website's structure, using descriptive URLs, and including relevant meta tags. The third pillar is engagement, which involves showing Google that users spend a lot of time on the web pages and engage with the content. This can be accomplished through compelling and high-quality content, as well as by encouraging users to share and interact with the content. The fourth pillar is authority, which involves showing Google that the content is credible and trusted by other reputable websites in the industry. This can be achieved through obtaining backlinks from authoritative sources and establishing a strong online presence. The author notes that SEO is a $70 billion industry, but it all comes down to these four pillars that Google wants to see from a website. The next chapters will focus on on-page optimization, specifically how to achieve relevance, crawlability, and engagement. On-page optimization is a one-time activity that, once done correctly, does not need to be revisited. The fourth pillar, website authority, will be covered in later chapters and is also known as off-page optimization.
