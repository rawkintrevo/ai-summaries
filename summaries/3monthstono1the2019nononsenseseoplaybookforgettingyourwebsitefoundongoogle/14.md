This chapter focuses on local area SEO, specifically targeting businesses that are localized in a specific geographical area. It explains that in order for Google to view a business as highly relevant to a particular location, the website's content should also reflect this. For example, an architect in New York City should have pages and content specifically targeted to the city, such as news feeds on municipal projects or a guide to the city's skyline.

The chapter highlights the importance of appearing in local search engine results pages (SERPs) and the Google map listings. It emphasizes the need to create a Google My Business profile in order to feature in the map listings. The chapter explains that businesses listed in the map listings have significant click-through rates, and being featured in both the map listings and the organic results can help dominate the local industry.

The chapter goes on to discuss the factors that influence the ranking of businesses in the map listings. These factors include the quantity of mentions of the business name, address, and phone number (NAP) across the internet, the consistency of the NAP information, and the number of 5-star Google reviews. It advises businesses to ensure their NAP information is consistent and to acquire directory citations from location-specific and niche-specific directories.

The chapter provides guidance on acquiring directory citations and advises against using automated submission software. It suggests submitting to 10 directories per week manually and recommends signing up for national, local, and industry-specific directories to maximize SEO value. The chapter also warns about upsells that may be offered during directory submissions.

The chapter emphasizes the importance of NAP consistency and explains that consistent and plentiful mentions of a business's NAP across the internet demonstrate trustworthiness and establishment to Google. It warns that even minor differences, such as the inclusion or exclusion of an apostrophe in the business name, can lead Google to perceive them as separate businesses. The chapter also highlights the importance of choosing the correct industry category for a business in Google's categorization.

The chapter provides a website that can check NAP citation locations and offers tips for getting positive Google reviews. It suggests using a review link generator to generate a short URL for customers to leave reviews and recommends asking friends and family to leave reviews if there aren't many happy customers yet.

Overall, the chapter emphasizes the importance of relevant content, citation listings, consistent NAP information, correct categorization, and positive Google reviews in local area SEO.
