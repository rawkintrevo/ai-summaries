Chapter 5 discusses the time it takes for SEO efforts to yield results. The author explains that the time frame varies depending on the strength of your website and the competition you face. The author provides some examples of time frames for achieving top positions in Google search results for different types of websites and keywords. For example, targeting longer keywords with fewer people searching for them can take around 2 months, while targeting highly competitive keywords nationally may take 12 months or longer. The author emphasizes that SEO is a slow process but can yield significant rewards.

In Chapter 6, the author discusses how Google works and the principles of search engines. The author emphasizes that Google is a business and its main goal is to provide the most relevant and useful search results to its users. Google builds its index of the web by crawling the internet with spiders or the Googlebot. When users search for something, Google matches their query with relevant web pages in its index using algorithms that consider over 200 ranking factors. The author also mentions the importance of user behavior in determining search rankings. Google monitors how users interact with search results and adjusts rankings accordingly.

Chapter 7 introduces the concept of becoming a pro SEO by applying a common sense check to SEO tasks. The author suggests asking oneself if performing a certain SEO task would be rewarded, punished, or considered indifferent by Google. This common sense check helps to avoid poor returns on time investment and potential penalties. The author highlights the importance of doing SEO properly by focusing on hundreds of small things done well. The author also warns against falling for the idea of a magic bullet solution in SEO and emphasizes the need for consistency and hard work.

Chapter 8 expands on the idea of the magic bullet fallacy in SEO. The author explains that in the past, there were quick and easy tactics that could rank a website highly in Google. However, as Google's algorithms have become more sophisticated, these tactics no longer work. The author argues that playing by the rules and focusing on long-term strategies is the best approach in SEO. The author also points out that the idea of a quick fix or magic bullet sells in the SEO industry, leading to a saturation of content promoting such ideas.

Overall, these chapters provide insights into the time frame for SEO results, how search engines work, and the importance of a common sense approach and consistency in SEO efforts. The author emphasizes the need for hard work, avoiding quick fixes, and understanding that SEO is a slow process with long-term rewards.
