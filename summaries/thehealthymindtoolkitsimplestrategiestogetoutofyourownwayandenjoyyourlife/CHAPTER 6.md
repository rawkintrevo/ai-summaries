Procrastination and avoidance can cause stress, anxiety, and a decrease in self-confidence. Avoidance creates a self-sabotaging cycle, making it difficult to overcome self-sabotage. In order to combat procrastination and avoidance, it is important to have a personal toolkit of strategies. 

The book provides a list of 21 strategies for breaking free from avoidance. It is recommended to find at least five strategies that resonate with you. The strategies are as follows:

1. Write a to-do list for each project: Instead of putting all tasks on a daily to-do list, write a project specific to-do list. This allows you to work through tasks as you have time and use scraps of time effectively.

2. Practice making a good enough decision: When facing a complex decision, briefly review your choices and then allow your instincts to guide you towards a final choice. Relying on instincts can lead to superior choices and is less mentally taxing.

3. Identify if a self-inflicted rule is causing avoidance: Check if the rule you've created for yourself is completely necessary. Simplify expectations and challenge self-imposed rules.

4. Decide not to do an item that has been hanging around on your to-do list: Prioritize tasks and focus on what is truly important. Pick a task that, although valuable, does not have a high return on investment.

5. Get a boost by boosting someone else: Expressing positive emotions towards others can help you feel more positive emotions. Positive emotions signal safety and encourage exploration rather than avoidance.

6. Determine if you're avoiding as a way of rebelling: Connect the avoided behavior with a personal value that's important to you. Find personal motivation for completing the task.

7. Pretend you're going to outsource the avoided task and write directions: Imagining someone else doing the task can make you realize that you're capable of doing it. Planning out the steps involved in the task can make it seem more achievable.

8. Try searching Google, YouTube, or Pinterest: Use the internet for help and ideas. Even if you don't need help, it can make you feel less alone in the task.

9. Limit how long you work on an avoided activity: Commit to working on the task for a specific amount of time to prevent burnout and boom and bust cycles.

10. Break your own rules: Occasionally breaking your own rules can help you push past avoidance. However, still set limits to prevent overworking.

11. Ask for help: Don't be afraid to ask for assistance or seek input from others who have experience or knowledge in the area you're avoiding.

12. Teach some aspect of whatever you're stuck with: Creating educational material or teaching someone else can make the task feel more manageable.

13. Move yo' body: Physically moving your body can kick-start your thinking and energy. Take a walk or engage in any activity that gets you moving.

14. Have fun with the idea that you've become a master of avoiding: Acknowledge your avoidance patterns in a lighthearted manner while also taking responsibility for making better choices.

15. Start in the middle: If the next step in your avoided task feels daunting, start with a step that feels more manageable.

16. Clear the decks: Clear your day and make a deal with yourself that once you've done the avoided task, the rest of the day is yours to do whatever you want. This strategy works well for extremely important tasks.

17. Correct distorted thinking to overcome anxiety-induced avoidance: Challenge negative thoughts and expectations about the task. Remind yourself that you could be wrong and that small amounts of regular work add up over time.

18. Be as clear as you can about what is and isn't avoidance: Distinguish between avoidance and taking breaks or prioritizing other tasks. Recognize when you genuinely do not want to do the task.

19. Project ahead to imagine how you'll feel once you're done: Imagining the feeling of relief and accomplishment can be motivating in some cases. However, be cautious as visualizing success can reduce the effort put into the task.

20. Use what already works for you more often: Keep track of strategies that naturally help you out of avoidance and increase your use of those strategies. Apply successful strategies from one life domain to other areas.

21. Get mere presence support: Ask someone to hang out with you while you do the avoided task, providing company rather than assistance. This can make the task feel less intimidating.

These strategies can be tailored to individual needs and situations. It is important to experiment and find what works best for overcoming procrastination and avoidance. If avoidance continues to be a major issue, seeking professional treatment may be necessary, especially if it is accompanied by depression.
