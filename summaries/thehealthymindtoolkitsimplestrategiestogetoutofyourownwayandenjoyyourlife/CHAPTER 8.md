In this chapter, the author discusses confirmation bias as a thinking error that leads to poor choices and distress. Confirmation bias is the tendency for individuals to seek out and focus on evidence that supports their existing beliefs or ideas, while ignoring or minimizing evidence that contradicts them. The author provides several examples of confirmation bias, such as a prospective home purchaser who is reluctant to change their view of a house even after a negative inspection, or a doctor who fails to consider other possible diagnoses after forming an initial one.

The author explains that once an opinion is formed, individuals tend to engage in behaviors that sustain their thinking errors. For example, a doctor may avoid asking a patient about symptoms that relate to alternative causes because it would challenge their initial diagnosis. The author suggests several strategies for minimizing the impact of confirmation bias, such as actively looking for evidence that contradicts one's view, being aware of forming conclusions too early, and seeking external feedback from experts.

The chapter also discusses the tendency for individuals to share negative information more often than positive information, especially in contexts that involve potential dangers or risks. This bias has evolved as a way to warn others of potential harm and is reinforced by individuals' need to self-validate their experiences and resolve any sense of injustice. The author notes that in modern life, this bias can lead to a skewed perception of reality, as individuals are more likely to encounter negative information when searching for information online. To counteract this bias, the author suggests using base rates and objective data to make decisions, seeking out positive stories to balance negative information, and paying attention to the relevance and number of reviews.

Another thinking bias discussed in the chapter is the tendency for individuals to believe that what is true for other people will not be true for them. This bias is characterized by the belief that one will be more rational and less susceptible to cognitive biases and behavioral missteps than others. The author provides several examples of this bias, such as believing that one will be able to remain unbiased in situations of conflict of interest or that one will be able to stick to a diet that others have failed at. The author suggests assuming that what is true for most people will be true for oneself and embracing the idea of being like everybody else rather than feeling disappointed for not being more special.

Lastly, the chapter addresses the tendency for individuals to delay seeking help for potentially serious health-related symptoms. This bias is driven by the belief that bad things are less likely to happen to oneself compared to others. The author provides suggestions for overcoming this bias, such as knowing what is normal for one's body, making personal appointments during free time, setting reminders for doctor's appointments, and creating lists of symptoms that warrant seeking medical attention. The author also emphasizes the importance of having a concrete plan for dealing with health problems and recognizing that one may be underestimating their ability to cope with potential adversity.

Overall, this chapter provides insights into common biases that affect decision making and the directions individuals take in their lives. By understanding and recognizing these biases, individuals can work towards making more informed and rational choices.
