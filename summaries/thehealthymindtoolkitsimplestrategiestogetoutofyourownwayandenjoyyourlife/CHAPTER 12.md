In this chapter, the author discusses four specific sabotaging patterns that relate to work: imposter syndrome, not finishing what you start, compulsively overworking, and avoiding difficult conversations. The author provides solutions and strategies to address each of these patterns.

Imposter syndrome is when individuals fear being revealed as a fraud, despite objective accomplishments. This can lead to chronic self-doubt and a fear of making mistakes or receiving negative feedback. The author suggests several solutions for overcoming imposter syndrome, including recognizing cognitive biases, valuing one's own expertise, seeking feedback, and understanding the role of self-confidence and self-doubt in achieving success.

The pattern of not finishing what you start can be addressed by preventing the problem from occurring in the first place. The author suggests strategies such as addressing cognitive errors, understanding the decisions that lead to unfinished tasks, prioritizing tasks, and establishing routines.

Compulsive overworking is a pattern of working excessively, often driven by a sense of mission or fear of failure. The author recommends giving oneself the experience of not overworking, practicing mindfulness and taking breaks, and finding ways to derive meaning and value from work without overworking.

Avoiding difficult conversations at work can hinder progress and communication. The author provides solutions for navigating these conversations, including putting oneself in the other person's shoes, taking responsibility for one's own actions and reactions, preparing for possible outcomes, and seeking advice or guidance when unsure.

In addition to addressing these sabotaging patterns, the author also discusses micro-self-sabotaging patterns that can have a negative impact on work productivity and satisfaction. These micro-patterns can be addressed through small adjustments, such as using checklists, setting time limits, and refuting cognitive biases.

Overall, the chapter provides practical strategies for overcoming self-sabotage at work and improving work performance. By addressing imposter syndrome, not finishing what you start, compulsive overworking, and avoiding difficult conversations, individuals can create a more positive and productive work environment.
